Southern Democrats were masters at bottling up legislation they hated, particularly bills expanding civil rights for black Americans. Their skills at obstruction were so admired that the newly sworn-in Johnson was firmly counseled by an ally against using the political capital he’d inherited as a result of the assassination on such a hopeless cause.</p><figure id="media-100000001500911" class="media photo embedded has-adjacency has-lede-adjacency layout-large-vertical media-100000001500911" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/06/books/review/0506-CLINTON-cover/0506-CLINTON-cover-popup.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="1287" itemprop="reviewBody">According to Caro, Johnson responded, “Well, what the hell’s the presidency for?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="1779" itemprop="reviewBody">This is the question every president must ask and answer. For Lyndon Johnson in the final weeks of 1963, the presidency was <em>for</em> two things: passing a civil rights bill with teeth, to replace the much weaker 1957 law he’d helped to pass as Senate majority leader, and launching the War on Poverty. That neither of these causes was in fact hopeless was clear possibly only to him, as few Americans in our history have matched Johnson’s knowledge of how to move legislation, and legislators.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="607" data-total-count="2386" itemprop="reviewBody">It’s wonderful to watch Johnson’s confidence catch fire and spread to the shellshocked survivors of the Kennedy administration as it dawned on them that the man who was once Master of the Senate would now be a chief executive with more ability to move legislation through the House and Senate than just about any other president in history. Johnson’s fire spread outward until it touched the entire country during his first State of the Union address. The words were written by Kennedy’s speechwriter Ted Sorensen, but their impact would be felt in the magic L.B.J. worked over the next seven weeks.</p><div id="Moses" class="ad moses-ad nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

We’ve all seen the iconic photos of L.B.J. leaning into a conversation, poking his thick finger into a confidant’s chest or wrapping his long arm around a shoulder. At 6 foot 4, he towered over most men, but even seated Johnson commanded from on high. Caro relates how during a conversation about civil rights, he placed Roy Wilkins and his N.A.A.C.P. entourage on one of the couches in the Oval Office, yet still towered over them as he sat up close in his rocking chair. And he didn’t need to be in the same room — he was great at manipulating, cajoling and even bullying over the phone.</p><div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

His flattery was minutely detailed, finely tuned and perfectly modulated. So was his bombast — whatever worked. L.B.J. didn’t kiss Sam Rayburn’s ring, but his lips did press against his bald head. Harry Byrd received deference and attention. When L.B.J. became president, he finally had the power to match his political skills.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="575" data-total-count="4515" itemprop="reviewBody">The other remarkable part of this volume covers the tribulation before the triumphs: the lost campaign and the interminable years as vice president, in which L.B.J.’s skills were stymied and his power was negligible. He had little to do, less to say, and no defense against the indignities the Kennedys’ inner circle heaped on him. The Master of the Senate may have become its president, but in title only. He might have agreed with his fellow Texan John Nance Garner, F.D.R.’s vice president, who famously described the office as “not worth a bucket of warm spit.”</p><aside class="marginalia comments-marginalia  comment-prompt-marginalia" data-marginalia-type="sprinkled" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-7">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="687" data-total-count="5202" itemprop="reviewBody" id="story-continues-7">Caro paints a vivid picture of L.B.J.’s misery. We can feel Johnson’s ambition ebb, and believe with him that his political life was over, as he was shut out of meetings, unwelcome on Air Force One, mistrusted and despised by Robert Kennedy. While in Congress he may not have been universally admired among the Washington elite, and was even mocked by them as a bit of a rube. But he had certainly never been <em>pitied</em>. In the White House, he invented reasons to come to the outskirts of the Oval Office in the mornings, where he was rarely welcome, and made sure his presence was noted by Kennedy’s staff. Even if they did not respect him, he wasn’t going to let anyone forget him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="544" data-total-count="5746" itemprop="reviewBody">Then tragedy changed everything. Within hours of President Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson was sworn in as president, without the pomp of an inauguration, but with all the powers of the office. At first he was careful in wielding them. He didn’t move into the Oval Office for days, running the executive branch from Room 274 in the Executive Office Building. The family didn’t move into the White House residence until Dec. 7. But soon enough, it would become clear that the power Johnson had grasped for his entire life was finally his.</p><aside class="marginalia comments-marginalia  selected-comment-marginalia" data-marginalia-type="sprinkled" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-8">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="6122" itemprop="reviewBody" id="story-continues-8">As Caro shows in this and his preceding volumes, power ultimately reveals character. For L.B.J., becoming president freed him to embrace parts of his past that, for political or other reasons, had remained under wraps. Suddenly there was no longer a reason to dissociate himself from the poverty and failure of his childhood. Power released the source of Johnson’s humanity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="6550" itemprop="reviewBody">Last year I was privileged to speak at the funeral of Sargent Shriver — a man who served L.B.J. but who in many ways was his temperamental opposite. I said then that too many of us spend too much time worrying about advancement or personal gain at the expense of effort. We might fail, but we need to get caught <em>trying</em>. That was Shriver’s great virtue. With Johnson’s election he actually had the chance to try and to win.</p><div id="MiddleRight2" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

They believed government had an essential part to play in expanding civil rights and reducing poverty and inequality. It soon became clear that <em>hearts</em> needed to be changed, along with laws. Not just Congress, but the American people themselves needed to be <em>got to</em>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="462" data-total-count="7546" itemprop="reviewBody">It was hard to do, absent a crisis like the losses of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. By the late 1960s, America’s increasing involvement and frustration in Vietnam, the rise of more militant civil rights leaders and riots in many cities, and the end of broad-based economic growth that had indeed “lifted all boats” in the early ’60s, made it harder and harder to win more converts to the civil rights and anti­poverty causes.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-10">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="622" data-total-count="8168" itemprop="reviewBody" id="story-continues-10">But for a few brief years, Lyndon Johnson, once a fairly conventional Southern Democrat, constrained by his constituents and his overriding hunger for power, rose above his political past and personal limitations, to embrace and promote his boyhood dreams of opportunity and equality for all Americans. After all the years of striving for power, once he had it, he said to the American people, “I’ll let you in on a secret — I mean to use it.” And use it he did to pass the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the open housing law, the antipoverty legislation, Medicare and Medicaid, Head Start and much more.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="8342" itemprop="reviewBody">He knew what the presidency was for: to get to people — to members of Congress, often with tricks up his sleeve; to the American people, by wearing his heart on his sleeve.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="427" data-total-count="8769" itemprop="reviewBody">Even when we parted company over the Vietnam War, I never hated L.B.J. the way many young people of my generation came to. I couldn’t. What he did to advance civil rights and equal opportunity was too important. I remain grateful to him. L.B.J. got to me, and after all these years, he still does. With this fascinating and meticulous account of how and why he did it, Robert Caro has once again done America a great service.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="1055" itemprop="articleBody">His body was found in his house the next day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="397" data-total-count="1452" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Contrubis was one of eight people who drowned during Hurricane Sandy in Midland Beach, a small, low-slung neighborhood of one-story bungalows and newer two- and three-story houses. The eight lived within about eight short blocks of one another — apparently the highest concentration of deaths in the United States attributable to the storm, which killed more than 100 people in this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="1936" itemprop="articleBody">One of the bodies was discovered only on Friday, nearly two weeks after the storm. The deaths have raised unsettling questions about why the victims were in their homes when the storm hit and whether the city bore some responsibility for their failure to evacuate. Relatives, friends and officials have replayed the events of that night, pondering whether they should have done something different — and whether the city needs to improve its evacuation procedures for future storms.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="2120" itemprop="articleBody">Midland Beach is part of Zone A, a collection of neighborhoods in the city deemed most at risk of flooding. The city declared a mandatory evacuation of the zone before Hurricane Sandy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="2280" itemprop="articleBody">Last year, in the days before Tropical Storm Irene, city workers visited the neighborhood, broadcasting evacuation warnings by loudspeaker, residents recalled.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="2487" itemprop="articleBody">This time, officials said, city workers were sent once again to Staten Island’s evacuation zones to issue warnings, some using loudspeakers. But many residents of Midland Beach said they did not hear them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="2789" itemprop="articleBody">Still, it is not at all certain that such a measure, or even the police’s going door to door, would have made a difference. Like most of the neighborhood’s residents, the victims ignored numerous orders to evacuate, a decision that underscores an independent streak that runs deep on Staten Island.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="3109" itemprop="articleBody">“I tried very hard,” Ms. Contrubis said through sobs at her brother’s funeral on Monday. “Before the storm I called him up and said, ‘Gene, the storm, it looks bad!’ And he said, ‘Everybody’s staying; nobody’s leaving.’ He just told me: ‘I’m not going to leave. I’m not going to leave.’ ”</p><div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Most lived alone, and one was legally blind, paraplegic and had cerebral palsy. On that night, the neighborhood turned into a lake that was more than nine feet deep in some places — nearly enough to fill the victims’ homes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="3526" itemprop="articleBody">Councilman <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/d50/html/members/home.shtml">James Oddo</a>, a Republican who represents the area, said he was distressed that a cluster of such deaths could occur.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="3637" itemprop="articleBody">“It weighs heavily on me,” Mr. Oddo said. “It means to a certain degree that we in government failed.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="24" data-total-count="3661" itemprop="articleBody"><strong> Lulled Into Complacency</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="3997" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Contrubis’s parents bought the bungalow at 162 Kiswick Street in the 1960s as a summer cottage. At the time, they lived in Manhattan, but Mr. Contrubis’s mother loved the beach and she eventually moved to Staten Island full time.

Bloomberg ordered a mandatory evacuation of Zone A — which includes neighborhoods in all five boroughs — at 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 28, the day before the storm hit.

One of these groups passed through Midland Beach, officials said, with the mission of knocking on doors and warning people in the streets.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="16244" itemprop="articleBody">But the campaigns in residential neighborhoods appear to have been more modest than those in the city’s public housing projects in Zone A, where Housing Authority workers knocked on every apartment door and made repeat visits to the homes of the most infirm, city officials said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="16512" itemprop="articleBody">Linda Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, said the city works with nonprofit groups to coordinate the evacuation of homebound older residents. But if people are not in facilities like hospitals, she said, getting them to evacuate can be challenging.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="88" data-total-count="16600" itemprop="articleBody">“If a person does not want to leave their own home, we cannot force them,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="16807" itemprop="articleBody">In the end, only about half of the residents in Zone A around the city evacuated, officials estimated. In Midland Beach, residents said they believed that an even smaller percentage left their neighborhood.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="16961" itemprop="articleBody">Refusal to obey a mandatory evacuation order is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail. Yet the authorities rarely make arrests in such cases.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="17052" itemprop="articleBody">Officials now say they plan to conduct a thorough review of the Hurricane Sandy evacuation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="135" data-total-count="17187" itemprop="articleBody">“We are going to look at people who left and people who didn’t, and we’re going to talk to them about why,” Mr. Holloway said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="17479" itemprop="articleBody">Asked if the deaths in Midland Beach reflected a failure of the city’s evacuation efforts, he responded that the term “failure” might apply “if the city didn’t have a plan and this came upon us and we were going on the fly.” But he added: “A hurricane is a foreseeable thing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="17546" itemprop="articleBody">“We have a plan for that,” he said, “and we’ve done it.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="17566" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Decisions to Be Made</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="17826" itemprop="articleBody">Since the storm passed, residents have re-entered their homes and sorted through their mud-caked belongings. They have hauled sodden possessions — furniture, appliances, clothes, heirlooms, photo albums — to the curb for the sanitation trucks to cart away.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="17956" itemprop="articleBody">Many are vowing to rebuild. Others, even those whose families have lived in Midland Beach for generations, are considering moving.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="111" data-total-count="18067" itemprop="articleBody">“This is the first time water has ever come into the house, ” Mr. Owens, the retired police officer, said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="18286" itemprop="articleBody">He was standing in front of the two homes his great-grandfather, an immigrant from France, built on Olympia Boulevard. He and family members were tearing down the walls and gutting the first floor of the two structures.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="18407" itemprop="articleBody">“Eighty-four years we’ve been here,” he said. He shook his head: “Now, I’ve got to stop and think about it.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="166" data-total-count="18573" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Sammarco, who sounded the early warning on Father Capodanno Boulevard, said she might abandon not only the waterfront blocks, but also the neighborhood entirely.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="18719" itemprop="articleBody">“For the first time in my life, it crossed my mind,” she said. “Am I going to be all right? With every rainstorm, are we going to panic?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="18783" itemprop="articleBody">The trauma has only deepened as more discoveries have been made.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="19092" itemprop="articleBody">Nearly four days after the storm, police officers emerged from a bungalow on Olympia Boulevard carrying two corpses in body bags. Officials were trying to confirm the victims’ full names, but their landlord said they were siblings. The brother, David, was 65, and the sister, Charlotte, was in her mid-70s.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-13">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="19273" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-13">They had died with their dogs, cats, birds, a rabbit and a hamster. If they were unable to evacuate their entire menagerie, they had told the landlord, they were going to stay home.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="19420" itemprop="articleBody">On Friday, long after the floodwaters had drained, police officers on patrol were flagged down and asked to check on a bungalow on Mapleton Avenue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="19566" itemprop="articleBody">Building inspectors had already come by, but they had apparently not gone inside. When the officers did, they found the body of a 64-year-old man.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he snow burst through the trees with no warning but a last-second whoosh of sound, a two-story wall of white and Chris Rudolph&rsquo;s piercing cry: &ldquo;Avalanche! Elyse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very thing the 16 skiers and snowboarders had sought &mdash; fresh, soft snow &mdash; instantly became the enemy. Somewhere above, a pristine meadow cracked in the shape of a lightning bolt, slicing a slab nearly 200 feet across and 3 feet deep. Gravity did the rest.</p>
<p>Snow shattered and spilled down the slope. Within seconds, the avalanche was the size of more than a thousand cars barreling down the mountain and weighed millions of pounds. Moving about 7o miles per hour, it crashed through the sturdy old-growth trees, snapping their limbs and shredding bark from their trunks. </p>
<p>The avalanche, in Washington&rsquo;s Cascades in February, slid past some trees and rocks, like ocean swells around a ship&rsquo;s prow. Others it captured and added to its violent load. </p>
<p>Somewhere inside, it also carried people. How many, no one knew.</p>
<p>The slope of the terrain, shaped like a funnel, squeezed the growing swell of churning snow into a steep, twisting gorge. It moved in surges, like a roller coaster on a series of drops and high-banked turns. It accelerated as the slope steepened and the weight of the slide pushed from behind. It slithered through shallower pitches. The energy raised the temperature of the snow a couple of degrees, and the friction carved striations high in the icy sides of the canyon walls.</p>
<p>Elyse Saugstad, a professional skier, wore a backpack equipped with an air bag, a relatively new and expensive part of the arsenal that backcountry users increasingly carry to ease their minds and increase survival odds in case of an avalanche. About to be overtaken, she pulled a cord near her chest. She was knocked down before she knew if the canister of compressed air inflated winged pillows behind her head. </p>
<p>She had no control of her body as she tumbled downhill. She did not know up from down. It was not unlike being cartwheeled in a relentlessly crashing wave. But snow does not recede. It swallows its victims. It does not spit them out.</p>
<p>Snow filled her mouth. She caromed off things she never saw, tumbling through a cluttered canyon like a steel marble falling through pins in a pachinko machine. </p>
<p>At first she thought she would be embarrassed that she had deployed her air bag, that the other expert skiers she was with, more than a dozen of them, would have a good laugh at her panicked overreaction. Seconds later, tumbling uncontrollably inside a ribbon of speeding snow, she was sure this was how she was going to die.</p>
<p>Moving, roiling snow turns into something closer to liquid, thick like lava. But when it stops, it instantly freezes solid. The laws of physics and chemistry transform a meadow of fine powder into a wreckage of icy chunks. Saugstad&rsquo;s pinwheeling body would freeze into whatever position it was in the moment the snow stopped. </p>
<p>After about a minute, the creek bed vomited the debris into a gently sloped meadow. Saugstad felt the snow slow and tried to keep her hands in front of her. She knew from avalanche safety courses that outstretched hands might puncture the ice surface and alert rescuers. She knew that if victims ended up buried under the snow, cupped hands in front of the face could provide a small pocket of air for the mouth and nose. Without it, the first breaths could create a suffocating ice mask. </p>
<p>The avalanche spread and stopped, locking everything it carried into an icy cocoon. It was now a jagged, virtually impenetrable pile of ice, longer than a football field and nearly as wide. As if newly plowed, it rose in rugged contrast to the surrounding fields of undisturbed snow, 20 feet tall in spots. </p>

<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger">Saugstad was mummified</span>. She was on her back, her head pointed downhill. Her goggles were off. Her nose ring had been ripped away. She felt the crushing weight of snow on her chest. She could not move her legs. One boot still had a ski attached to it. She could not lift her head because it was locked into the ice. </p>
<p>But she could see the sky. Her face was covered only with loose snow. Her hands, too, stuck out of the snow, one still covered by a pink mitten. </p>

<p>Using her hands like windshield wipers, she tried to flick snow away from her mouth. When she clawed at her chest and neck, the crumbs maddeningly slid back onto her face. She grew claustrophobic. </p>
<p>Breathe easy, she told herself. Do not panic. Help will come. She stared at the low, gray clouds. She had not noticed the noise as she hurtled down the mountain. Now, she was suddenly struck by the silence.</p>

<h3>Tunnel Creek</h3>
<p>The Cascades are among the craggiest of American mountain ranges, roughly cut, as if carved with a chain saw. In summer, the gray peaks are sprinkled with glaciers. In winter, they are smothered in some of North America&rsquo;s deepest snowpack.</p>
<p>The top of Cowboy Mountain, about 75 miles east of Seattle, rises to 5,853 feet &mdash; about half the height of the tallest Cascades, but higher than its nearest neighbors, enough to provide 360-degree views. It feels more like a long fin than a summit, a few feet wide in parts. Locals call it Cowboy Ridge.</p>
<p>To one side, down steep chutes, is Stevens Pass ski area, which receives about 400,000 visitors each winter. To the other, outside the ski area&rsquo;s boundary to what is considered the back of Cowboy Mountain, is an unmonitored play area of reliably deep snow, a &ldquo;powder stash,&rdquo; known as Tunnel Creek.</p>

<p>It is a term with broad meaning. The name is derived from the Cascade Tunnel, originally a 2.6-mile railroad tube completed in 1900 that connected the east and west sides of the Cascades, a boon for the growth of Seattle and Puget Sound. The mountain pass that it burrowed beneath was named for the project&rsquo;s engineer, John Frank Stevens, who later helped build the Panama Canal.</p>

<div class="caption">Wreckage after the Wellington, Wash., avalanche in 1910, which buried two passenger trains marooned by snowstorms outside the Cascade Tunnel and killed 96 people. Rescue workers transported bodies from the scene on sleds. <span class="credit">Museum of History &amp; Industry</span></div>
</div>
<p>In late February 1910, ceaseless snowstorms over several days marooned two passenger trains just outside the tunnel&rsquo;s west portal. Before the tracks could be cleared, the trains were buried by what still stands as the nation&rsquo;s deadliest avalanche. It killed 96 people.</p>
<p>Bodies were extricated and wrapped in blankets from the Great Northern Railway, then hauled away on sleds. Some were not found until the snow melted many months later. </p>
<p>To skiers and snowboarders today, Tunnel Creek is a serendipitous junction of place and powder. It features nearly 3,000 vertical feet &mdash; a rarely matched descent &mdash; of open meadows framed by thick stands of trees. Steep gullies drain each spring&rsquo;s runoff to the valley floor and into a small, short gorge called Tunnel Creek.</p>
<p>The area has all of the alluring qualities of the backcountry &mdash; fresh snow, expert terrain and relative solitude &mdash; but few of the customary inconveniences. Reaching Tunnel Creek from Stevens Pass ski area requires a ride of just more than five minutes up SkyLine Express, a high-speed four-person chairlift, followed by a shorter ride up Seventh Heaven, a steep two-person lift. Slip through the open boundary gate, with its &ldquo;continue at your own risk&rdquo; warning signs, and hike 10 minutes to the top of Cowboy Mountain. </p>
<p>When snow conditions are right, the preferred method of descent used by those experienced in Tunnel Creek, based on the shared wisdom passed over generations, is to hopscotch down the mountain through a series of long meadows. Weave down the first meadow, maybe punctuate the run with a jump off a rock outcropping near the bottom, then veer hard left, up and out of the narrowing gully and into the next open glade.</p>
<p>Another powder-filled drop ends with another hard left, into another meadow that leads to the valley floor.</p>

<p>Tunnel Creek is, in the vernacular of locals, a &ldquo;hippie pow run&rdquo; &mdash; breezy and unobstructed, the kind that <span class="nytmm_video_trigger" data-trigger="theme_video">makes skiers giggle in glee</span> as they descend through a billowing cloud of their own soft powder and emerge at the bottom coated in white frosting.</p>
<p>Despite trends toward extreme skiing (now called freeskiing), with improbable descents over cliffs and down chutes that test the guile of even the fiercest daredevils, the ageless lure of fresh, smooth powder endures.</p>
<p>But powder and people are key ingredients for avalanches. And the worry among avalanche forecasters, snow-science experts and search-and-rescue leaders is that the number of fatalities &mdash; roughly 200 around the world each year &mdash; will keep rising as the rush to the backcountry continues among skiers, snowboarders, climbers and snowmobilers. </p>
<p>The backcountry represents the fastest-growing segment of the ski industry. More than ever, people are looking for fresh descents accessible by helicopters, hiking or even the simple ride up a chairlift.</p>
<p>Before 1980, it was unusual to have more than 10 avalanche deaths in the United States each winter. There were 34 last season, including 20 skiers and snowboarders. Eight victims were skiing out of bounds, legally, with a lift ticket. And many of the dead were backcountry experts intimate with the terrain that killed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cultural shift, where more skiers are going farther, faster, bigger,&rdquo; said John Stifter, the editor of Powder magazine, who was a part of the group at Tunnel Creek in February. &ldquo;Which is tending to push your pro skiers or other experienced, elite-level backcountry skiers that much farther, faster and bigger, to the point where there&rsquo;s no margin for error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one knows how many avalanches occur. Most naturally triggered slides are never seen. Those set off by humans are rarely reported unless they cause fatalities or property damage. </p>
<p>But avalanches occur in Tunnel Creek regularly. Its slopes, mostly from 40 to 45 degrees, are optimal for avalanches &mdash; flat enough to hold deep reservoirs of snow, yet steep enough for the snow to slide long distances when prompted. The long elevation drop means snow can be fluffy at the top and slushy at the bottom. Temperatures, wind and precipitation change quickly, and something as welcome as a burst of sunshine can alter the crystallized bonds deep inside the snow. And because Tunnel Creek is outside the ski area, it is not patrolled or specifically assessed for danger.</p>
<p>In March 2011, a University of Washington student was caught in an avalanche in Tunnel Creek. Having been carried into a stand of trees, he was unburied by friends within minutes and found dead. Three others were partially buried about an hour later when the ski patrol&rsquo;s arrival set off a second avalanche. </p>
<p>Many of the most experienced locals view Tunnel Creek with a mix of awe and fear. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a naysayer of Tunnel Creek,&rdquo; the snowboarder Tim Wesley said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a big avalanche back there before. It has about 2,600 vertical feet. Not typical. The snow changes a lot in that distance. That&rsquo;s the reason I always have a second thought about Tunnel Creek. In Washington, there&rsquo;s a saying: If you don&rsquo;t like the weather, wait five minutes. And it&rsquo;s true. You&rsquo;ll be on the chair and it&rsquo;ll be freezing, and then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a warm breeze that smells like the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even those who are not leery of Tunnel Creek on the best days heed the pass-it-on warning of the experienced: stay left.</p>
<p>To head straight down to the bottom is to enter what experts call a terrain trap: a funnel of trouble and clumsy skiing, clogged with trees and rocks and confined by high walls. Few go that way intentionally.</p>

<p>Chris Rudolph, the effervescent 30-year-old marketing manager for Stevens Pass, knew the preferred route down. Tunnel Creek was his favorite at-work diversion. Earlier that weekend, he mentioned plans for a field trip to Tunnel Creek to a select group of high-powered guests and close friends.</p>
<p>The operations manager for Stevens Pass agreed to pick up the group in one of the ski area&rsquo;s trucks at the end of its descent. From the bottom of Tunnel Creek, it is about a half-mile trek through deep snow to U.S. 2, then a four-mile ride back to Stevens Pass.</p>
<p>At 11:32 a.m. on Sunday, Feb. 19, heading up the mountain, Rudolph sent a text message to the operations manager. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A big posse,&rdquo; Rudolph wrote.</p>
<!--SUB CHAPTER //-->
<h3>A Plan in Motion</h3>
<p>Like many ideas that sound good at the time, skiing Tunnel Creek was an idea hatched in a bar. </p>
<p>It was Saturday, Feb. 18, the afternoon light fading to dusk. Outside the Foggy Goggle, a bar at the base of the ski area, the snow continued to fall, roughly an inch an hour. By morning, there would be 32 inches of fresh snow at Stevens Pass, 21 of them in a 24-hour period of Saturday and Saturday night.</p>
<p>That was cause for celebration. It had been more than two weeks since the last decent snowfall. Finally, the tired layer of hard, crusty snow was gone, buried deep under powder.</p>
<p><span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="rudolph">Rudolph</span> promoted Stevens Pass with restless zeal. In seven years there, he helped turn a relatively small, roadside ski area into a hip destination. </p>
<p>He unabashedly courted ski journalists and filmmakers to take a look. They, in turn, gave Stevens Pass star turns in magazines and popular ski movies, raising the area&rsquo;s cool quotient. </p>
<p>Rudolph was the oldest of three children raised in California&rsquo;s Bay Area by outdoors-minded parents. The young family pulled a pop-up Coleman camper around the West and skied at the areas around Lake Tahoe. The grown siblings continued to vacation with their parents, climbing peaks like Mount Whitney in California and Mount Rainier in Washington. </p>
<p>Rudolph peppered his language with words like &ldquo;rad&rdquo; and &ldquo;stoked.&rdquo; But he was no simple-minded ski bum. He was an Eagle Scout with a marketing degree. When he applied at Stevens Pass years earlier, he sent a video of himself speaking, skiing and mountain biking. He included a bag of popcorn for the viewer. He got the job. </p>
<p>Children knew Rudolph because he kept his pockets full of Stevens Pass stickers. He starred in self-deprecating Webcasts promoting Stevens Pass. He wrote poetry on his blog and strummed a guitar. He drank Pabst Blue Ribbon, the unofficial beer of irony and the hipster generation. </p>
<p>Tunnel Creek was where he took special guests. And it is where he wanted to take the tangled assortment of high-caliber skiers and industry insiders who, as if carried by the latest storm, had blown into Stevens Pass that weekend.</p>
<p>Many of them happened into the Foggy Goggle on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Among them were professional skiers like <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="saugstad">Saugstad</span>, 33, a former champion of the Freeride World Tour. There were reporters and editors from Powder magazine and ESPN. There were executives from ski equipment and apparel companies. There were Stevens Pass regulars, some with broad reputations in the niche world of skiing, glad to spend time with the assortment of guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very, very deep, heavy, powerful, strong group of pro skiers and ski industry people,&rdquo; said <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="carlsen">Keith Carlsen</span>, a photographer and former editor of Powder.</p>
<p>Rudolph was the connecting thread. Some visitors, like Saugstad, were at Stevens Pass for a promotional event aimed at expert female skiers, sponsored by Salomon, the ski equipment maker. Rudolph skied with the group all day Saturday. He organized and hosted a catered dinner for the women later that night in Leavenworth, a serious outdoors town dressed as a Bavarian village, 35 miles downhill to the east.</p>
<p>Powder had come to spotlight Stevens Pass for a feature article on night skiing. When the magazine&rsquo;s editor, <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" title="John Stifter"  data-tag="stifter">John Stifter</span>, arrived by train to Leavenworth two days earlier, he found Rudolph&rsquo;s car waiting for him. Inside were keys to the car, keys to a slope-side cabin and two Pabst Blue Ribbons in the cup holders.</p>
<p>At the bar, Rudolph mentioned an idea to a few people: Tunnel Creek on Sunday. Invitations traveled in whispers and text messages, through a knot of friendships and slight acquaintances. </p>
<p>Meet at the fire pit, on the stone deck at Granite Peaks Lodge, at 11. Rudolph thought his Sunday morning staff meeting would end by then.</p>

<p>As darkness enveloped Stevens Pass on Saturday night, stadium-style lights flooded the slopes in white light, and snowflakes fell in cotton-ball clumps.</p>
<p>Rudolph and those with the Salomon event left for dinner in Leavenworth. Stifter, 29, and Carlsen, 38, headed outside to work on their article for Powder.</p>

<div class="caption">Several of those with plans to ski Tunnel Creek the next day huddled around a fire in front of Tim Wangen&rsquo;s trailer. Among the assembled were Jim Jack, in red pants, and Tiffany Abraham, in red jacket. <span class="credit">Keith Carlsen</span></div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I skied just off the trail, not out of bounds, but in the ski resort, to shoot some of these night shots I took,&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;And in tree wells I was, like, neck deep &mdash; easily nipple deep, wading around in snow, trying to get my angle. There was so much new snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the daytime crowds gone, the nighttime atmosphere was festive and the faces were familiar. Families played in the deepening snow. More serious skiers and snowboarders sought the freshest powder. </p>
<p>There are no public accommodations at Stevens Pass, only a parking lot available to a few dozen campers and recreational vehicles. As the evening wound down, several of those with loose plans to ski Tunnel Creek the next morning huddled in the R.V. lot around a fire. Carlsen continued taking photographs. Stifter and others ducked inside one camper to watch homemade videos of others skiing Tunnel Creek over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s something they skied often,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;Not something like, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to go ski Tunnel!&rsquo; Not like a once-a-year deal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The flames in the fire died to orange embers. The last beers were sipped empty, and people slipped into the night. The campers were blanketed with snow.</p>
<p>Beyond the lights glowing from the ski area, snow still fell over the ridge, too, in the vast darkness of steep meadows and narrow gullies just past the western edge of Stevens Pass. </p>
<p>Each snowflake added to the depth, and each snowflake added to the weight. It might take a million snowflakes for a skier to notice the difference. It might take just one for a mountain to move. </p>

<p>After getting the latest assessment from the area&rsquo;s full-time avalanche forecaster, more than a dozen patrollers filled their backpacks with 2.2-pound emulsion charges, shaped like cartoon dynamite. Chairlifts rumbled to life, ferrying the crews up the dark mountain. </p>
<p>Three two-person teams assigned to Cowboy Ridge removed their skis and filed through the boundary gate. They took turns plowing a path through the fresh snow with their bodies. Their boots forged an icy stairway to the top of the skinny ridge.</p>
<p>Back on their skis, facing down into the ski area and with their backs to Tunnel Creek, they spread across the ridge to stamp and destroy wind-swept cornices, small balconies of crusty snow. </p>
<p>They removed the charges from their packs. Like party poppers that spew confetti, charges have a pull-wire, an ignition that lights a 90-second fuse. The patrollers lobbed the lighted charges into the many steep chutes below them. With muffled booms, heavy waves of snow tumbled harmlessly into the recesses of the empty slopes below, clearing danger for the day&rsquo;s thousands of inbounds customers.</p>
<p>The lines for the ski lifts began forming about 7, two hours before they were to open. When the gathering skiers and snowboarders heard the explosions echo down the mountain, they cheered. It signaled a powder day.</p>
<p>In Leavenworth, Chris Rudolph awoke in his two-bedroom house on Ash Street, the one that he and his girlfriend, Anne Hessburg, painted a rich blue and accented with a garden out front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris was so mad that he had a meeting,&rdquo; Hessburg said. &ldquo;It was a pow day, and you couldn&rsquo;t tie him to his desk on pow days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he thought the meeting would end by 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be so good, babe. I&rsquo;m going to take some folks up to Tunnel Creek,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Hessburg said. &ldquo;Tunnel Creek, it was kind of like the holy grail for Chris. It was where he wanted to show off for friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among those who joined the 45-minute parade from Leavenworth, through tight Tumwater Canyon, past the Lake Wenatchee turnoff and up to Stevens Pass, were <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="abrams">Dan Abrams</span> and <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="michelson">Megan Michelson</span>. They planned to marry in March.</p>
<p>Michelson, 30, was the freeskiing editor for ESPN.com. Abrams, 34, was a founder and the president of Flylow, maker of apparel marketed to backcountry users.</p>
<p>The couple lived in Seattle, but had come to Stevens Pass on Saturday for the Salomon promotional event. Michelson and the other women stayed at a Leavenworth hotel. Abrams slept in a spare bedroom at Rudolph&rsquo;s house. He and Michelson drove to Stevens Pass together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said to Dan, &lsquo;Do you think Tunnel will be safe today?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Michelson said. &ldquo;He said something along the lines of, &lsquo;Yeah, those guys know the best route down.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were similar conversations elsewhere. In the slope-side cabin at Stevens Pass that Rudolph arranged &mdash; he cleaned it on Friday as he spoke to his mother on the phone &mdash; the journalists from Powder magazine, Stifter and Carlsen, contemplated the day&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started asking questions,&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>Where are we going? Out of bounds? Didn&rsquo;t it just snow nonstop for two days? How much snow?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s when John pulled up the avalanche report, and he read it aloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger">Mark Moore, director and lead meteorologist</span> of the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center, had set that day&rsquo;s forecast on Saturday afternoon. A 64-year-old with graying hair pulled into a short ponytail, Moore had a feeling it could be a busy weekend.</p>
<p>The avalanche center, based in Seattle, is one of about 20 regional avalanche forecasting centers in the United States, most run by the Forest Service. During the winter, one of its three employees arrives in the middle of the night, analyzes weather maps and computer models, and examines data &mdash; snowfall, temperatures, wind, humidity and so on &mdash; from 47 remote weather stations scattered across the mountains, including five in the vicinity of Stevens Pass. They take calls from ski patrollers and highway crews.</p>
<p>The biggest storm of the season increased avalanche concerns. But it was not just the new snow that concerned Moore. It was what lay nearly three feet beneath &mdash; a thin layer of perfectly preserved frost called surface hoar. The frozen equivalent of dew, created on crisp, clear nights, it features fragile, featherlike crystals that grow skyward. </p>
<p>On the surface, they glimmer like a million tiny diamonds. When frosted and protected by soft blankets of fluffy snow, they are weak stilts supporting all that falls on top. When they finally give way, falling like microscopic dominoes on a steep slope, they provide an icy flume for the snow above.</p>
<p>A shot of rain or above-freezing temperatures, both common in Cascade winters, usually destroy the fragile crystals, melding them into the snowpack. But five days of dry, cold weather, from Feb. 3 to 7, created a perfect, sparkly layer of surface hoar. Sporadic light snow, never more than an inch or two a day, delicately shrouded it over the next 10 days.</p>
<p>By the weekend, as snow fell heavily over the Cascades and powder-hungry hordes took to the slopes, the old layer was long out of sight, and mostly out of mind.</p>
<p>Not to Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snowpack is never static,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s changing, even once it&rsquo;s buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Changes in temperatures, precipitation, humidity and wind can turn a benign snowpack into a deadly one, and vice versa. Sometimes weather is enough to start an avalanche. But &ldquo;natural&rdquo; avalanches rarely kill. The majority of avalanche fatalities are in human-triggered slides &mdash; usually of the victims&rsquo; own making.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every skier, everyone who hits the slope, changes the structure of the snowpack,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Even though they don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the rugged area of the Cascades that includes Stevens Pass, Moore deemed the avalanche danger &ldquo;high&rdquo; &mdash; the fourth degree out of five &mdash; for slopes above 5,000 feet in elevation, facing north to southeast.</p>
<p>For everything else, the danger level was deemed &ldquo;considerable,&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;dangerous avalanche conditions&rdquo; with &ldquo;human-triggered avalanches likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The top of Cowboy Mountain is nearly 6,000 feet. The Tunnel Creek terrain descends off its southwest side to roughly 3,000 feet. Officially, the danger was &ldquo;considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In avalanche forecasting terms, &lsquo;considerable&rsquo; is a really weird forecast,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s this gray area. It&rsquo;s a hard one to predict. It can mean, well, you&rsquo;re not going to see any activity. Or, if something goes, you&rsquo;re going to be screwed. It&rsquo;s hard to work with that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s forecast offered more specifics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although decreasing light showers and decreasing winds are expected Sunday, cold temperatures should slow stabilization of existing wind slabs and help maintain the threat of further human-triggered avalanche activity, especially on previously wind-loaded terrain showing no evidence of recent avalanche activity,&rdquo; Moore wrote. </p>
<p>Spotty afternoon sunshine, he added, could raise the danger, especially on south-facing slopes.</p>

<p>The snow had stopped at Stevens Pass by the time the lifts opened Sunday morning. The runs were quickly doodled with curvy lines. </p>
<p>Stifter sat in the cabin and examined the forecast on his laptop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have this image burned in my head,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;I had a coffee cup in my right hand, I was reading e-mails, and I read the Northwest Avalanche Center report. And it said &lsquo;considerable to high&rsquo; was the avalanche danger. And I read it out loud to Keith. And he listened, and I read it again &mdash; I read it twice &mdash; and looked at it. Huh. I&rsquo;ve skied enough to know that when it snows a lot, which it did, up to two feet, there&rsquo;s always going to be instability, with that much weight on an older snowpack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stifter left Carlsen behind and headed to the lifts. He found <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="jack">Jim Jack</span>. If anyone could judge terrain and snow in the backcountry, it was Jim Jack.</p>
<p>The license plate on Jack&rsquo;s Subaru Brat as a teenager read &ldquo;IM JIM.&rdquo; To family and his closest friends, he was Jimmy, sometimes J.J. To most everyone else, he was Jim Jack, blended into one name, accent on the first syllable: JIM-jack. </p>
<p>Jack was the head judge and former president of the International Freeskiers Association, which oversaw a world tour of competitions. At 46, he was a sort of Peter Pan of the ski world, a charismatic, carefree boy who never grew up, beloved by like-minded skiers and snowboarders half his age. </p>
<p>He spent winters traveling the world, spreading the gospel of freeskiing, professing the beauty of finding improbable ways down precarious slopes with grace, nerve and flair. He had been a competitor on the tour, distinguishable from great distances by the silkiness of his loose form, until he landed hard and took his own knee to his face, shattering the bones around his right eye. You could feel the screws when you touched his face.</p>
<p>He was a party accelerator with a penchant for streaking. He did drama in high school and never declined the stage as an adult. On Halloween, his costumes played off his name: Jack on the Rocks, Jim Jack in the Box, Cracker Jack, Jack Frost.</p>
<p>Wearing lederhosen, Jack starred in a cheeky promotional video for Leavenworth. He was a sure-handed shortstop for the team from Uncle Uli&rsquo;s, a bar and restaurant in the heart of town. A grilled chicken sandwich on the menu, smothered in spicy sauce, is named the Napkin&rsquo; Slappin&rsquo; Jim Jack.</p>
<p>Jack shared a bungalow off the highway, near the Howard Johnson, with his longtime girlfriend, Tiffany Abraham. They danced late at night in the kitchen and built bonfires in the backyard. The covered front porch held a pile of ski gear and a futon couch, perfect for watching the world go by, beer in hand. </p>
<p>Jack drove a 1994 Chevy pickup with 216,000 miles on it, topped by a Wilderness camper that he added for $350. Widely recognized on the highways and in ski area parking lots around the West, it was held together largely by duct tape and bungee cords. The radio&rsquo;s volume was stuck on high. If it is too loud, Jack told passengers, just roll down the window.</p>
<p>Jack and his camper rolled into the R.V. parking lot at Stevens Pass on Friday night. On weekends, when the snow was good, the lot filled with dozens of pickup campers and motor homes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I woke up on Saturday in my R.V.,&rdquo; said <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="wangen">Tim Wangen</span>, a 53-year-old former commercial diver who lived in a cabin at nearby Lake Wenatchee. &ldquo;When I wake up, I look outside to see who is next to me. I saw that Jim Jack was next to me. I thought, cool, I got a great neighbor this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Wangen had skied a couple of runs Sunday morning by the time Stifter caught up to them. Wangen knew Tunnel Creek as well as anyone, having skied it since he was a boy. Jack traveled the world, scouting courses for extreme skiing. He knew how to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Stifter asked Jack about the avalanche report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;Yeah, not to worry,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>We&rsquo;ll just do it slowly and safely and just stay in the trees.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<!--subhead //-->
<h3 class="nytmm_left_margin">&lsquo;Gear Up?&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The fire pit sits at the center of the bustle on busy days. At the corner of the patio, in front of the lodge, it is a crossroads for people coming and going. Some pull up chairs and relax, facing the bowl of ski runs strung before them. When the clouds lift, Cowboy Mountain dominates the view high to the right. It can feel close enough to reach and touch. </p>
<p>By midmorning, the fire pit began attracting a growing but confused band of expert skiers. Some were local, some were visitors. Some knew others, some did not, but most knew either Chris Rudolph or Jim Jack. They traded nods and handshakes, unsure if others were headed to Tunnel Creek, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know why everyone was there,&rdquo; said Dan Abrams, there with Megan Michelson. &ldquo;We wondered if everyone was meeting up for the same reason. But it&rsquo;s like when you find out where the extra keg is at the party. You don&rsquo;t go tell everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="hammond">Joel Hammond</span>, the 37-year-old regional sales representative for Salomon, had teamed with Rudolph to organize the previous day&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s event. He did not intend to ski Sunday until he awoke in Leavenworth and could not resist the lure of the fresh snow. He drove to Stevens Pass and sent a text message to Rudolph, still in a staff meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris was like: &lsquo;Meet at the fire pit, where everybody meets. Then we&rsquo;re going to rally up,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Hammond said.</p>
<p>Hammond told Jack that he had the latest model of skis in his truck, then left to retrieve a pair for him to try. Stifter bought coffee, a couple of Americanos, from the stand for himself and Jack. </p>
<p><span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="carlson">Tim Carlson</span> and <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="pankey">Ron Pankey</span>, both 37 and childhood friends from Vermont, had spent the morning on the inbounds side of Cowboy Mountain, navigating near-vertical chutes and rock outcroppings. During a break, they spotted familiar faces near the fire pit. </p>
<p>Pankey was a former competitor on the Freeskiing World Tour, so he had known Jack since the mid-1990s. Like Jack, he eventually worked competitions around the world, including the X Games. </p>
<p>Carlson was a snowboarder, not a skier, and a regular at Stevens Pass. Earlier that week, he competed at Washington&rsquo;s Crystal Mountain. Jack worked the event, and Carlson slept several nights in Jack&rsquo;s camper.</p>
<p>When Carlson and Pankey arrived at Stevens Pass that Sunday, they joined <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="wesley">Tim Wesley</span>, known to most as Tall Tim &mdash; a lanky 39-year-old snowboarder from Leavenworth. The three merged with those waiting for Rudolph.</p>
<p>Another arrival was <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="peikert">Wenzel Peikert</span>, 29, an off-duty Stevens Pass ski instructor from Seattle. Skiing over the weekend without his wife and infant daughter, he hung around the Foggy Goggle and the R.V. lot on Saturday night. He, too, sent a message to Rudolph on Sunday, confirming the plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote, &lsquo;Gear up?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;And he wrote, &lsquo;Yeah, for sure.&rsquo; So I went into the ski school and grabbed my pack, with my beacon, probe and shovel. I went to the fire pit and I met the whole group. You could tell they were a different level of skier by how they acted and how they dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the strangers he saw was <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="castillo">Rob Castillo</span>, a 40-year-old father of two and former competitive skier. He had exchanged text messages with Jack. </p>
<p>Castillo and Jack lived together in Alta, Utah, for several years in the 1990s. They went helicopter skiing in Alaska and skied down mountains they had climbed in Washington. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tunnel Creek at 11,&rdquo; Jack wrote. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; Castillo thought. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wanted to do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>At the fire pit, Castillo considered the others. </p>

<div class="nytmm_divider light"></div>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of like, &lsquo;All right, this group is getting bigger,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t pop in with a bunch of no-names, necessarily, and trust any of them, but the ones I knew were definitely qualified to go. And they&rsquo;re not going to bring people out who aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than anything, Castillo wanted to ski for the first time all season with his two best friends at Stevens Pass &ndash; Jack and <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="brenan">Johnny Brenan</span>. </p>
<p>In the R.V. parking lot, a few hundred yards away, Johnny and Laurie Brenan convened in their motor home for an early lunch with their daughters, Josie, 10, and Nina, 7, part of the Stevens Pass ski teams. </p>
<p>Brenan, 41, grew up comfortably in the Seattle suburbs, not far from Jack. He followed his passion for skiing to Breckenridge, Colo., working as a ski patroller in the winter and a carpenter in the summer. A burly man whose five o&rsquo;clock shadow arrived by noon each day, he eventually opened a business that he named for home: Cascade Contracting. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Johnny at the Gold Pan in Breckenridge,&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;It was Thursday night, 25-cent beer night. He was sitting on the pool table, and he had an open spot next to him. And I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to go sit next to that cute guy.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>They married in 1997 and moved to Leavenworth. Brenan worked as a cabinetmaker, then resurrected Cascade Contracting. On the strength of Brenan&rsquo;s amicable personality and no-fear creativity, it blossomed with custom homes and expansive remodels.</p>
<p>The Brenans bought a deteriorated 100-year-old farmhouse on a hill in an apple orchard. Johnny Brenan lifted the structure on jacks, rebuilt the foundation and gutted the inside, intending to resell it as a bed-and-breakfast. The Brenans kept it for themselves to raise their family. </p>
<p>Brenan zipped from one construction site to another in his truck. He coached soccer teams. He held Monday night poker games in the garage, which Nina always helped prepare. He built a chicken coop in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny and Josie bought five chickens, and they called the business Eggs, Ink,&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;They had signs and business cards. Then they bought 30 more chickens. It&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s 5 years old. But the more the merrier for Johnny, even with chickens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sunday began perfectly for Brenan. The family R.V. was parked in space No. 3, where the satellite dish picked up the best television reception. Brenan was at the front of the lift line at dawn. </p>
<p>He offered to fetch coffee for those behind him, a trick he used to keep his place while he helped Laurie get their daughters fed and dressed. He returned to the line, excited for an increasingly rare chance to ski with old friends like Jack. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped the kids off for ski team about 8:45,&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;I remember looking down and Johnny was yelling at Jim Jack, doing something with his hands, something crazy. They were like little boys in a candy store. They were so excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back with his family for lunch, Brenan ate an egg sandwich and discussed a business deal on the phone. It was after 11, and he was afraid he would miss the Tunnel Creek run. </p>
<p>But Rudolph sent a couple of people text messages at about 11:15. He apologized for running late, and said he would be out in about 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Brenan had time. He made a pact with Josie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josie, be ready at 2,&rdquo; Brenan said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to come back and we&rsquo;ll go on a powder mission. Be here, because I&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenan strapped on his avalanche beacon, also called a transceiver, a device that emits a silent signal for others to detect your location in case of burial. A friend in the R.V. noted that its batteries were dead. Brenan replaced them with fresh ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Papa?&rdquo; Nina asked her father. </p>
<p>Brenan paused to show her how it worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He explained it,&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;It was understood that avalanche beacons were really for body recovery. Not many people survive avalanches. He would say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenan gathered his things and headed toward the fire pit to join his friends. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s safe?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;He looked me right in the eye and said: &lsquo;Of course. I wouldn&rsquo;t be going if it weren&rsquo;t.&rsquo; I said O.K. because I knew that was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At about 11:30, Rudolph burst through the doors of the lodge at Stevens Pass. He was surprised by the size of the group waiting for him, but he barely broke stride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me out of here before another spreadsheet finds me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The group, jolted into action, scattered to gather gear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all rallied up, jumped on the lifts,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I remember seeing some other buddies of mine later, like: &lsquo;Oh, I wanted to go out so bad with you guys that day. It looked like such a fun crew.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">Looking south across U.S. 2, where Stevens Pass is nestled between Big Chief Mountain, left, and Cowboy Mountain, right, in the Cascades. <span class="credit">Chase Jarvis</span></div>
</div>
<p>Stevens Pass opened in the winter of 1937-38 with a rope tow on Big Chief Mountain. A lodge and five new tows were added in the 1940s, including a mile-long T-bar that pulled people up the side of Cowboy Mountain. The ski area took shape in the bowl below the crescent-shape ridge that connects the two mountains. </p>
<p>Seventh Heaven, a two-person lift up a steep wall of Cowboy Mountain, changed the complexion of Stevens Pass when it was built in 1960. It opened a high swath of expert terrain, now marked as double diamond &mdash; experts only &mdash; on posted signs and the ski map. </p>
<p>It also provided easy access to the top of the high ridgeline. Back then, few people dared to remove their skis and hike the few hundred extra feet to the summit. &ldquo;When I was younger at Stevens, no one skied off Cowboy &mdash; maybe just a few locals,&rdquo; said Wangen, who has skied the area for nearly five decades. &ldquo;But the last 20 years, it&rsquo;s gone ballistic.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now there is a steady procession of expert skiers and snowboarders through the boundary gate next to the top of the lift. Most drop off the left side of the ridge, back into the resort, through the rocky and narrow chutes. </p>
<p>Those who drop away from the ski area, toward Tunnel Creek, are simply following a much wider trend into &ldquo;sidecountry&rdquo; &mdash; backcountry slopes easily entered by lifts and, sometimes, a short hike. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the term &lsquo;sidecountry,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Moore, the avalanche forecaster, said. &ldquo;It makes it sound like &lsquo;backcountry light.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rise of backcountry skiing can be credited to a collision of factors. </p>
<p>Ski areas that once vigilantly policed their boundaries, from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to Squaw Valley, Calif., have gradually opened their gates to the territory surrounding them. While that has led to wrangling over liability issues and raised debate over search-and-rescue responsibilities, most areas note that they are carved out of public land. They really cannot keep people from going there.</p>
<p>But ski areas also see the potential to attract more ticket-buying customers, and more influential ones, by blurring the boundary lines. Many areas slyly promote not just the terrain inside their borders, but the wilder topography beyond, using the power of media and word of mouth &mdash; as Rudolph did for Stevens Pass. </p>
<p>Skiing adjacent to ski areas, however, can numb people to risk. Easy access, familiar terrain and a belief that help is just a short distance away may lead people to descend slopes they might avoid in deeper wilderness. </p>
<p>While most backcountry users would not consider entering known avalanche territory without a beacon, one study last winter at Loveland Ski Area in Colorado found that fewer than 40 percent of people who passed through a boundary gate wore one.</p>
<p>Equipment advances have emboldened people. Intermediate powder skiers have been turned into expert ones thanks to fatter skis and the &ldquo;rocker&rdquo; shape of their tips &mdash; design advances borrowed from snowboarding. Popular ski bindings now temporarily detach at the heel, allowing skiers to glide up rises like a cross-country skier, then reconnect so they can descend like a professional downhiller. </p>
<p>Snowboards have borrowed from skis, too. Some models can be quickly split into two pieces, allowing users to stride up short hills in pursuit of bigger descents.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nytmm_article">
<div class="inner_article clearfix">
<div class="left">
<p>Similar advances in safety gear, such as easy-to-use digital beacons and <span class="nytmm_video_trigger graphic" data-trigger="airbag_graphic">air bags</span>, have helped make the backcountry feel less dangerous. Beacons help rescuers find people buried under the snow, while air bags deploy a large balloon meant to help keep the skier closer to the surface of an avalanche. A leading American manufacturer of safety gear is named, appropriately, Backcountry Access.</p>
<p>Companies, including Salomon and Flylow, have marketed heavily to ride the backcountry trend. They are keenly aware that many buyers will never ski the backcountry but want to dress the part.</p>
<p>Those marketing shifts have coincided with a generation raised on the glorification of risk. From X Games to YouTube videos, helmet cameras to social media, the culture rewards vicarious thrills and video one-upmanship. This generation no longer automatically adheres to the axiom of waiting a day for safer conditions. The relative placidness of inbounds skiing is no match for the greater adventure of untamed terrain.</p>
<p>Among avalanche forecasters and the growing cottage industry of safety instructors, there is pride in noting that the number of fatalities has risen at a slower rate than the number of backcountry users. But they see themselves as part of a difficult race between the coming hordes and the tools to protect them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You could argue that skiers have never been this educated or safe,&rdquo; Stifter, the Powder magazine editor, said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a huge emergence and emphasis on avalanche classes. Then you also have this lifesaving technology. But if you go to Jackson or Utah, you&rsquo;ll see people who are not educated, who are just going out there because they see it in the movies and they see it in magazines like Powder: there&rsquo;s fresh tracks and, man, it looks like fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the top of Seventh Heaven, the members of the group took off their skis and snowboards. Directly to the right of the lift&rsquo;s unloading ramp was a narrow trail that disappeared up through a clog of trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; one sign read in all capital letters. &ldquo;Ski Area Boundary. Minimum of $1000.00 rescue fee! Do you have a partner, beacon, probe and shovel? Explosives may be used in this area at any time. Continue at your own risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smaller sign read: &ldquo;Stop. Ski Area Boundary. No ski patrol or snow control beyond this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the right was a gray steel box. It was labeled, &ldquo;Avalanche Transceiver Check Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk by and it goes beep, beep,&rdquo; Rob Castillo said. &ldquo;So as we were going through, you heard it going all the way, right on everyone. Beep. Beep. Beep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While there are no laws dictating what equipment people carry into the backcountry, there is a code. Carry a beacon (for sending and receiving signals), a probe (for poking for victims in the snow) and a shovel (for digging them out).</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you go in the backcountry, you&rsquo;re trusting your life in the hands of everybody else and they&rsquo;re trusting their life in you,&rdquo; Michelson said. &ldquo;If I get buried and my ski partner doesn&rsquo;t have a beacon, shovel or probe, it&rsquo;s my life on the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One member of the party did not elicit a beep:  <span class="nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="dessert">Erin Dessert</span>, a 35-year-old snowboarder who was early for her afternoon shift as a Stevens Pass lift operator. Wesley invited her along. She thought everyone was riding off the front side of Cowboy Mountain, back into the ski area. </p>
<p>The group marched single file along the narrow ridge for a few minutes until it reached a wider area to convene. Tracks dropped back over a steep edge and into the ski area to the left. </p>
<p>To the right was nothing but deep powder, hidden by thick trees, like a curtain to the big attraction.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here were 16 people, although no one thought to count at the time. Their ages ranged from 29 to 53.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a crew that seemed like it was assembled by some higher force,&rdquo; Dessert said.</p>
<p>It was about 11:45. The storm had passed. A low, pewter sky hid the surrounding peaks. Castillo glanced around at the others, wearing helmets and rainbow hues, a kaleidoscope of color amid the gray surroundings, like sprinkles on vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, wow, what a bunch of heavies,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There was loose banter and a few casual introductions. Not everyone met everyone else. Someone pulled out marijuana to smoke, and passed it.</p>
<p>Wesley, the snowboarder known as Tall Tim, saw the size of the assembled group. More than a dozen, he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That never happens,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s basically the legends of Stevens Pass standing up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little doubt that those with Tunnel Creek experience knew the way. About half the group had been down dozens of times each, if not hundreds. The others would follow.</p>

<div class="caption bottom_align"><div class="bottom">Among the 16 skiers and snowboarders who congregated at the top of Cowboy Mountain were, from left, Ron Pankey, Chris Rudolph, Rob Castillo, Joel Hammond and Wenzel Peikert. <span class="credit">Erin Dessert</span></div></div>
</div>
<p>There was no broad discussion of the route down. Pockets of the group talked about staying left, not being too greedy by going too far down the meadow before cutting across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That run, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s supersteep, or there are cliffs, or that it&rsquo;s a really rowdy run,&rdquo; Carlson, one of the Stevens Pass regulars, said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that if anything goes wrong, it&rsquo;s a terrain trap. If somebody happens to set off even a slough slide and you&rsquo;re below them in Tunnel, it all bottlenecks and really adds up superfast. That&rsquo;s the reason that run is heavy. It&rsquo;s notorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unspoken anxiety spread among those unfamiliar with the descent. The mere size of the group spooked some. Backcountry users of all types &mdash; skiers, snowboarders, snowmobilers and climbers &mdash; worry about how much of a load a slope can absorb before it gives way. They worry about people above them causing an avalanche. When it comes to the backcountry, there is usually not safety in large numbers. </p>
<p>That is not only because of the physical impact on the snow. It is because of the complicated dynamics that large groups create. Deadly avalanches are usually the product of bad decisions &mdash; human nature, not Mother Nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was up to me, I would never have gone backcountry skiing with 12 people,&rdquo; Michelson, the ESPN journalist, said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just way too many. But there were sort of the social dynamics of that &mdash; where I didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to say, you know, &lsquo;Hey, this is too big a group and we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this.&rsquo; I was invited by someone else, so I didn&rsquo;t want to stand up and cause a fuss. And not to play the gender card, but there were 2 girls and 10 guys, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be the whiny female figure, you know? So I just followed along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others suppressed reservations, too. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing felt rushed to me, and it felt kind of like this covert operation,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;Which it kind of was, because you&rsquo;re going out of bounds. It&rsquo;s obviously acceptable, especially when you&rsquo;re going out there with all these locals and the director of marketing. It&rsquo;s not illegal or anything. It just had this rushed feeling from the time Chris walked out of the office, and he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlsen, Stifter&rsquo;s Powder colleague, was uneasy. He tried to convince himself that it was a good idea. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way this entire group can make a decision that isn&rsquo;t smart,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s fine, if we&rsquo;re all going. It&rsquo;s got to be fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="nytmm_reel_tag" data-tag="hikein"></span>After a few minutes, the small talk faded. Worries went unexpressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re up on top of a peak like that, it&rsquo;s usually hang out for a second, and then it&rsquo;s momentum,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;You just kind of feel it. Everyone&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;O.K., we&rsquo;re not here to hang out. Let&rsquo;s start going.&rsquo; So I saw people starting to slide, get going, and I was like: &lsquo;Hey, Johnny, partner up. Buddy system. Let&rsquo;s go. Me and you.&rsquo; And at that point, it clicked. Everyone&rsquo;s like, yeah, partners, partners, partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a tenet of avalanche safety, and the command snapped the group to attention. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone said, &lsquo;Partner up &mdash; everyone should grab a partner,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;Immediately I thought, We&rsquo;re in a somewhat serious situation. It wasn&rsquo;t just grab a partner so you don&rsquo;t get lost. It was grab a partner so you. ...</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just felt bigger all of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudolph, the Stevens Pass marketing director, teamed with Saugstad, the professional skier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really excited about that,&rdquo; Saugstad said, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s just such a cool guy and I thought, wow, cool, he wants to be my partner. A very trustworthy guy that&rsquo;s an amazing skier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack, on borrowed Salomon skis, paired with Joel Hammond, the Salomon representative. Carlson looked at Pankey, his childhood friend. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re coming with me,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="107"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="108"></span>
<p><span class="nytmm_reel_tag" data-tag="firstpaths"></span>Wesley gave a little whistle to Carlson and Pankey and nodded downhill. He wanted to be first. The conditions were too good to waste time, and he did not want to be slowed by the huge pack. </p>
<p>With little warning, Wesley dropped straight through the large cluster of trees, using firs as a slalom course. Pankey and Carlson followed.</p>
<p>Rudolph, always up for competition, sped around the trees, not through them. He curved around a banked C-shape turn that dropped him a couple hundred feet into the broad meadow below.</p>
<p>He arrived just in time to see Wesley, Pankey and Carlson burst from the trees into the open powder. Rudolph pointed his ski poles and playfully shouted invectives as their tracks crossed.</p>
<p>Wesley laughed, and his two friends followed him left and over a small rise. </p>
<p>Rudolph headed straight down the mountain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember looking back at where he was going and being confused,&rdquo; Wesley said. &ldquo;Like, &lsquo;Where is he going?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the locals in the group presumed they knew what the others were thinking. They did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you know an avalanche is not very likely, that&rsquo;s a great way to go,&rdquo; Wesley said of Rudolph&rsquo;s choice to ski straight down farther. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s three open glades of awesome powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier that morning, Wesley and Carlson had skied the opposite side of Cowboy Mountain, in the ski area. It had been cleared of avalanches by the ski patrol at dawn, but the two still triggered several slough slides &mdash; small, shallow avalanches that washed at their feet and petered out before snagging victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, when they said we&rsquo;re doing Tunnel, I was like, &lsquo;Ooh, dicey,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Wesley said. </p>
<p>Pankey and Carlson followed Wesley and looked back, too, wondering why Rudolph and the others were not following them toward relatively safer terrain. Within a minute, long enough to be well out of sight of the group they left behind, the three men found something that made them stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were right on top of a knoll, a little rollover, where we were about to make some really fun turns, and <span class="nytmm_video_trigger">we saw that the face had already slid</span>,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;It was pretty large.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">After breaking from the larger group, Ron Pankey and two others discover nearby avalanche activity.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Alarmed, the three decided to go farther left. They crossed through trees and avoided big meadows and steep pitches. They soon found evidence of another avalanche, this one cutting through the forest. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really never seen anything slide in the trees like that,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;And that was definitely like: &lsquo;Holy cow, we shouldn&rsquo;t be back here, Ron. Let&rsquo;s go left. Let&rsquo;s go hard left.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wesley had disappeared in the pale light. He left nothing but a track through the deep snow that the others tried to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just went, and didn&rsquo;t really stop,&rdquo; Wesley said. &ldquo;I went all the way down. But I&rsquo;ve never taken a run where I looked uphill more times in fear.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="reel_tag" data-start="181"></span>
<p>Rudolph stopped on the left edge of the upper meadow, above a cluster of trees. Others filed behind him, spilling down the mountain in plumes of spraying snow. </p>
<p>Erin Dessert did not follow. She was confused. She was once a Tunnel Creek regular, until a nonfatal avalanche captured five friends in 2002 and scared her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris Rudolph&rsquo;s, like, totally all about safety protocol and mountain awareness and wisdom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That guy knows the conditions like an animal. He has instincts. It didn&rsquo;t register, even for a second, that he might be bringing this group to Tunnel Creek. It wasn&rsquo;t logical. I thought we were doing the front side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She headed hard to the right, away from the others. The other snowboarders that she knew, Carlson and Wesley, were gone in the opposite direction. Some in the remaining group noticed Dessert heading away in the distance and dismissed her as an oblivious backcountry rookie. She dipped out of sight in a lonely panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been riding Stevens Pass since I was 3 years old,&rdquo; Dessert said. &ldquo;I can tell circumstances, and I just felt like something besides myself was in charge. They&rsquo;re all so professional and intelligent and driven and powerful and riding with athletic prowess, yet everything in my mind was going off, wanting to tell them to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudolph and the others, now a group of 12, were focused downhill. It was 11:52 a.m. Rudolph did not wait for the back of the pack to arrive before continuing to demonstrate the way.</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="239"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="240"></span>
<p>&ldquo;So <span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="rudolph">Chris Rudolph</span> went first, and then he pulled into the trees and we waited for a sec,&rdquo; said Castillo, who was near the front of the group, wearing a helmet camera. &ldquo;He goes out of sight and behind the trees. So I said, &lsquo;O.K., Megan, go ahead, spoon those tracks, and you&rsquo;ll see Chris on the left.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not Megan Michelson. It was Elyse Saugstad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was Megan,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Are you Megan?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m Elyse.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s when I met Elyse. It was right there. And she made these turns that were like: &lsquo;Aah, I think I know who that is. I&rsquo;ve seen her name. Those are pro turns.&rsquo; She ripped the hell out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="329"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="330"></span>
<p><span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="saugstad">Saugstad</span> traced through the knee-deep snow just to the right of Rudolph&rsquo;s elongated S-shape tracks. She dipped through trees at a pinch in the meadow and disappeared out of sight. <span class="nytmm_video_trigger">She crossed over Rudolph&rsquo;s tracks and giggled</span>. After about 30 seconds, she was back at Rudolph&rsquo;s side, having cut left into a notch of the trees again.</p>

<div class="caption">Elyse Saugstad, second in the group, skis Tunnel Creek.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We skied to an area that was probably about 500 feet down or so from where we started,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;And where we skied to was an area of old-growth trees. You know, several-hundred-year-old trees. A very good indication that this is a safe place. Things don&rsquo;t happen here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo and Brenan teased each other about who would go next. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Go ahead, I got eyes on you,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Castillo said.</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="390"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="391"></span>
<p>From where Rudolph and Saugstad stopped, they could not see the subsequent skiers approach. <span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="castillo">Castillo</span> went past and cut left. His camera recorded Rudolph and Saugstad whooping their approval as he stopped in a shower of powder, about 40 feet below them.</p>
<p>But just before he stopped, Castillo was jolted by a weird sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little pang, like, ooh, this is a pretty heavy day out here,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;Thing&rsquo;s holding, but I remember having a feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo stopped above two trees. He nestled close and pushed his right ski tight against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of people think you should be below trees, but I stand above them,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather get pinned against this than taken through.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="450"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="451"></span>
<p>His helmet camera showed that 14 seconds after Castillo stopped, <span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="brenan">Brenan</span> appeared through the trees above Rudolph and Saugstad. Brenan had hugged the tree line on the left, avoiding the open meadow, then slalomed through the patch that the others used for protection. He stopped in a spray of snow a few feet from Rudolph and Saugstad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was sick!&rdquo; someone shouted.</p>
<p>Castillo silently took note of the terrain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was downhill from them &mdash; skier&rsquo;s right from them,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;But the trees that they were behind, I didn&rsquo;t think it was a bad spot to stop. They were huge. Giant old-growths that three of us probably can&rsquo;t put our hands around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he knew the direction of the slope did not follow the meadow. It dipped harder left into the trees, down toward a gully. And there were still a lot of skiers above them.</p>
<p>Saugstad was next to Rudolph. Brenan was a few feet away.</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="540"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="541"></span>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t straight across from each other, in a perfect horizontal line on the slope,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;We were peppered up and down, spread out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo kept his attention up the hill. Less than 30 seconds after Brenan stopped, he saw <span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="wangen">Tim Wangen</span> cut through the trees above the earlier arrivals, gliding horizontally through the forest. Wangen had been taught how to navigate Tunnel Creek by his father. He knew that the farther down the mountain he went, the harder it would be to cut over the ridge and into the next big meadow. He crossed the shallow gully and rose up the other side. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see the others when I cut over,&rdquo; Wangen said. &ldquo;I thought: Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a bad place to be. That&rsquo;s a bad place to be with that many people. But I didn&rsquo;t say anything. I didn&rsquo;t want to be the jerk.&rdquo;</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="630"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="631"></span>
<p>Wangen had told Peikert to follow his tracks, and <span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="peikert">Peikert</span> was close behind. Castillo watched where they went. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to cut over?&rdquo; Castillo shouted to those above him.</p>
<!--SUB CHAPTER //-->
<h3>Sliding Snow</h3>
<p>The start of an avalanche is unlike any other force of nature.</p>
<p>A hurricane is foretold by wind and lashing waves. A tornado often is spotted before it strikes. Lightning is usually presaged by black clouds and rumbling thunder.</p>
<p>Avalanches rarely provide such a warning. Unlike waves or wind, tremors or storms, they are usually triggered by their own victims, sometimes unaware of what has been unleashed. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you swim out in the ocean, the ocean&rsquo;s always alive,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;You can feel it. But the mountains feel like they&rsquo;re asleep.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Back up the mountain, Jack never seemed worried. That was his nature. Here he was, a rare weekend off, skiing with some of his best friends from Leavenworth and people from Powder and ESPN and all over the industry, on an epic run on a perfect powder day. </p>
<p>Carlsen, the Powder photographer, had never been to Tunnel Creek. The first few easy turns gave way to a slope that fell steeply away, out of sight. He sidled up to Jack.</p>
<span class="reel_tag" data-end="690"></span>
<span class="reel_tag" data-start="691"></span>
<p>&ldquo;I grabbed him, and I said, &lsquo;What is the move here?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;It was basically like, &lsquo;This is getting real, how do we handle it?&rsquo; He&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;Oh, no big deal. We go out here, swing out, make a few pow turns, and get back in the trees.&rsquo; I looked at him and said, &lsquo;Have a great run.&rsquo; Gave him a fist, a knuckle-to-knuckle high-five thing. And that was it. I watched him swing out, way out, skier&rsquo;s right, and then dive into his turn left.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="nytmm_reel_tag nytmm_character_tag nytmm_lightboxer" data-tag="jack">Jack</span> flowed through the thick powder with his typical ease. He skied the way other people walked down a sidewalk, a friend had said. </p>
<p>Jack disappeared over the knoll, gliding through the trees in the middle of the meadow. Behind him, the five remaining skiers watched in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked like he was having a great time, the run of his life, in fact,&rdquo; Michelson said. &ldquo;And he actually made, I remember, a little &lsquo;woo&rsquo; sound, as he dropped in on his first or second turn because the snow was really good. It was deep and light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the snow changed without warning.</p>
<p>Across the meadow, above Jack, loose snow seemed to chase him down the hill and out of sight.</p>
<p>Not everyone saw it. A couple did. They caught it in their peripheral vision and were unsure what to make of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was sketchy,&rdquo; Hammond said.</p>
<p>The five others listened. Not a sound. They stared for clues through the flat light below a murky sky. Nothing.</p>
<p>Silent seconds ticked. Finally, Hammond spotted the first sign of evidence. It came from a tree, one among thousands, far down the hill, almost out of sight. Only the top of it was visible, and it was covered in snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it moving,&rdquo; Hammond said. &ldquo;Like something had hit the tree, and it shook. And I could see the powder falling off the tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> few hundred yards down the mountain, a ghostly white fog rushed through the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;I saw it coming. But it was weird because it was coming through the trees. It was like snow billowing through the trees. Because it was such a treed area, I think for the first second I saw it I didn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wangen and Peikert had just traversed in front of its path. It did not miss them by much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d even come to a stop when I heard it,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;It was almost like wind and pressure more than noise. It literally felt like a freight train went over my tails. It wasn&rsquo;t a deep rumble. I could feel this rush of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a blur of white, its shattered pieces moving about 50 m.p.h., a powder cloud two stories tall. </p>
<p>Rudolph was the only one to scream. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Avalanche! Elyse!&rdquo; Rudolph shouted. </p>
<p>Saugstad tried to stride right, hoping to escape. She barely moved before snow flowed through her legs, dragging her down like a riptide.</p>
<p>She pulled the cord on her air bag. She was overwhelmed so quickly by the rising snow that she did not know if it inflated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no ability to control what was happening to me,&rdquo; Saugstad said. &ldquo;I was being tossed over and over and over. It was like being in a washing machine and all my body parts flailing every way. I didn&rsquo;t know which way was up. I didn&rsquo;t know which way was down. I couldn&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is likely to have tumbled just past Castillo. He groaned and turned his face away. He stuck his head between two trees, like a prisoner in a stockade. </p>
<p>For 16 seconds, snow and ice pounded his back and washed over him. His shoulders were jammed against the trees. His face pushed into branches of pine needles. He could feel the heavy assault of snow lashing at his back.</p>
<p>Trees cracked around him. Some in the path were chopped in half &mdash; the stumps left in the soil, the rest carried away in the growing torrent. </p>
<p>The avalanche, a relatively small one, started with about 6,000 cubic meters of snow and collected 7,000 cubic meters more on the way down. It probably weighed about 11 million pounds. </p>

<p>The trees Castillo hugged in each arm swayed but held. He told himself that when he felt the flow slow, he would pop a hand in the air so that it might stick out of the snow and make him easier to rescue. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I had the thought about what I&rsquo;m going to do, wondering if it was going to bury me, that&rsquo;s right when I could feel it,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;It was like a wave. Like when you&rsquo;re in the ocean and the tide moves away from you. You&rsquo;re getting thrashed and you feel it pull out and you&rsquo;re like, O.K., I can stand up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo saw daylight again. His camera captured snow sliding past his legs for another 13 seconds. The forest sounded as if it were full of sickly frogs. It was the trees, scrubbed of their fresh snow, still swaying and creaking around him.</p>
<p>Castillo turned to look back up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where there were three people, there was nobody,&rdquo; Castillo said.</p>
<!--SUB CHAPTER //-->
<h3>A Ticking Clock</h3>
<p>He did not know who or what set off the avalanche. He did not know how far down the mountain it went. All he knew was that about a dozen people had been above him a minute earlier, and that the gully below him descended another 2,000 vertical feet to the valley floor. </p>
<p>And he was alone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny! Johnny Brenan!&rdquo; Castillo screamed into the stillness, his voice escalating with panic. The scope of the disaster was too much to comprehend. He wanted to find his partner. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m screaming his name,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m screaming and screaming. Silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Streams of snow still flowed downhill as he scooted toward the heart of the slide path. It flowed into a wide gully, maybe 100 feet across, that narrowed as it descended. Castillo turned his beacon to &ldquo;search&rdquo; mode, meaning he would receive signals of those buried, but would not emit signals himself.</p>

<div class="caption">Left, the avalanche started with a large crack nearly 200 feet across and 3 feet deep that sent millions of pounds of snow down the mountain.

Below, the path the avalanche took as it crashed through trees and headed into a gully. <span class="credit">Stevens Pass Ski Patrol</span></div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be in this gully because I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming down next,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the next guy taken out. Now I don&rsquo;t even have a beacon on because I&rsquo;m on search. They&rsquo;re not going to find me if anything happens to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the gully, unable to see anyone else, either, Peikert and Wangen had gone into search mode, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was like, if there&rsquo;s someone in that, the clock&rsquo;s ticking,&rdquo; Peikert said.</p>
<p> Chances of survival drop precipitously every minute. According to a recent study, the survival rate for individuals completely buried in an avalanche falls to about 40 percent after 15 minutes of burial and to 25 percent after 30 minutes. About 75 percent of avalanche victims die from asphyxia or suffocation. The other 25 percent of fatalities result from trauma.  </p>
<p>Castillo spotted Peikert and Wangen across the gully. They, too, were nervous about hangfire, the unstable snow left along the edges of an avalanche&rsquo;s path that can release at any moment. </p>
<p>The avalanche had turned the gully into an oversize bobsled run, with slick, high-banked walls. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This gully&rsquo;s hard-core!&rdquo; Castillo yelled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wangen stayed mostly on the banks. Peikert and Castillo crossed the gully a couple of times, reluctantly and quickly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name again?&rdquo; Castillo shouted at Peikert. </p>
<p>It was soon apparent that the victims, however many there were, suffered one of two fates: they were hung up on the banks of the gully, snagged by a tree or buried in snow, or they had been flushed to the bottom, thousands of feet below.</p>
<p>If searchers spent too much time looking along the gully, they might squander a chance at rescuing someone at the bottom. If they rushed downhill, they might pass someone in need of saving. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We started to ski down, hoping to find him in a tree well or hanging on or something,&rdquo; said Castillo, his focus on Brenan. &ldquo;But I started to realize all the trees were bent over, and I started thinking, this is really fricking bad. And then I skied down to a point where I found Johnny&rsquo;s ski, probably three or four feet up in a tree. Stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo called 911. It was 12:02 p.m. The avalanche occurred seven minutes earlier.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m at Stevens Pass resort, on the backside of Tunnel Creek,&rdquo; Castillo told the King County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department dispatcher. He added, &ldquo;We had a major avalanche, and we might have three or four people missing, at least.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dispatcher asked him to slow down. Castillo, occasionally shouting at others nearby, tried to explain where the avalanche occurred. He was asked how many people there were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s at least 10,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;Between 10 and 12.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dispatcher asked if anybody was hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found them,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;I found one ski. It rolled through pretty heavy, man. I had partners right next to me and they&rsquo;re missing. I just found a ski about 1,000 yards down. Or 1,000 feet down.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The call lasted four minutes. Castillo, carrying his friend&rsquo;s ski, turned down the mountain.</p>

<p>Near the top, the five skiers who planned to follow Jim Jack deciphered what happened through a series of increasingly blunt clues. Loose snow. A shaking tree. </p>
<p>Hammond was due to ski next. He took a couple of turns through the fine powder of the meadow and stopped. There was a sudden drop, nearly three feet deep. The fluffy snow was gone. A surface of bluish ice stretched down the hill, into the trees and out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once I had gotten to the edge, I was like, oh my gosh, this thing ripped big,&rdquo; Hammond said. &ldquo;I could see the scope of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger">He shouted for everyone to go into search mode</span>. The other four skiers moved quickly to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all skied up to it and were like, holy smokes,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;From there all I remember was pulling out my phone. And I called Jim Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others started dialing numbers, too. They called Chris Rudolph and Elyse Saugstad. There were no answers. Hammond dropped onto the slick slide path. Another clue lay on the ice, pointing downhill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hopped out there and made one or two turns, and I saw one of Jim&rsquo;s skis,&rdquo; Hammond said. &ldquo;The only reason I recognized Jim&rsquo;s skis was that it was a pair of skis that he borrowed from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The realization that Jack had been carried away was a gut punch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one respect, you&rsquo;re like, oh no, a ski &mdash; where&rsquo;s Jim?&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;On the other hand, you think, O.K., there&rsquo;s his ski. Let&rsquo;s find him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Michelson called 911. According to sheriff&rsquo;s department records, it was 12:03 p.m.</p>
<div class="nytmm_audio">

<div class="caption"><span>Megan Michelson</span> 12:03 PM</div>
</div>
<p>Her voice was steady and sure. She patiently tried to explain where they were &mdash; &ldquo;The backside of the ski area in the backcountry,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Tunnel Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dispatcher asked if people were buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, yes,&rdquo; Michelson replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many. We have a large group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word was relayed to the ski area. Chris Brixey, manager of the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, had 17 patrollers working on the mountain that day, two more in the aid room, and a dispatcher. Brixey is a regular at Johnny Brenan&rsquo;s Monday night poker parties. He did not know that a group of friends, including Rudolph, his Stevens Pass co-worker, had gone to Tunnel Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to be walking through the aid room,&rdquo; Brixey said. &ldquo;Our dispatcher handed me a note that said 10 people are buried in Tunnel Creek. I called the 911 operator and got Megan&rsquo;s information. I called Megan directly. She said there&rsquo;s about 12 people and they were looking for eight people. I didn&rsquo;t know Megan. My gut feeling was that this was a group of inexperienced people who are now dealing with tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brixey called the area&rsquo;s most seasoned patroller and put him in charge of the four-member first-response unit, called the hasty team, to follow the group&rsquo;s trail. He also enlisted other patrollers and a pair of avalanche rescue dogs.</p>

<p>Word of a large avalanche in Tunnel Creek soon echoed around Stevens Pass, from the patrol room to the R.V. lot, up the lifts and down the slopes. According to the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol log, the area closed public access to the boundary gate atop the Seventh Heaven lift at 12:19. </p>
<p>By then, the group that had started off together less than 30 minutes earlier was strewn up and down nearly 3,000 vertical feet. No one knew how many were missing.</p>
<p>Keith Carlsen was nearest the top, searching for Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought someone has to make sure he&rsquo;s not still up here,&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t likely, but his ski was there, and he got swept, and there&rsquo;s no sign of him, so maybe he got pummeled into the snow, into a hole, somewhere, right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others headed down, scanning the path and its edges with their beacons. Carlsen methodically checked the upper meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was going to be the one to find him, and I would find him alone,&rdquo; Carlsen said. &ldquo;And the bed surface at the top was rock hard. And I&rsquo;m thinking: I&rsquo;m going to get a signal, and this guy&rsquo;s going to be buried, and I&rsquo;m going to have to somehow dig him out. I&rsquo;m going to find Jim Jack.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Scared and alone, Carlsen&rsquo;s voice broke the silence.</p>

<div class="caption">Photographs from the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol accident report, taken a day after the Tunnel Creek avalanche, showed its twisting path. After starting in a broad meadow, the avalanche funneled into a narrow ravine. <span class="credit">Stevens Pass Ski Patrol</span></div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, and I remember repeating this in my head: &lsquo;Jim, am I about to find you? Jim, are you underneath me? Jim, where the hell are you? Is this possible? Is he really underneath here? Am I about to dig Jim out?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther down, others followed the path into the gully. As it descends toward the valley floor, it carves deeper into the mountain. In some spots, canyon walls are 20 feet high. There were steep, icy drops that would become gushing waterfalls during the spring runoff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are places it&rsquo;s so tight that I would stop and my skis would straddle the middle,&rdquo; Hammond said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d be elevated, like being on springs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still clogged with rocks and trees that had not been fully scoured away. Where the ravine bent, the avalanche rode high on the outside wall, like a child on a water slide, sometimes breaking over the top of the bank and unearthing trees on the ridges. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fear,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;Fear that you lost someone, and fear that you&rsquo;re standing in an avalanche path. You&rsquo;re thinking, Don&rsquo;t get caught up on trees, listen for the beacons, where&rsquo;s my fianc&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It became increasingly evident that whoever was caught in the avalanche would be found at the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably went down for one or two minutes and I got no signal,&rdquo; Michelson said. &ldquo;I shouted: &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve gone all the way down! The way this gully is, they&rsquo;ve been flushed.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>im Carlson and Ron Pankey, having split from the big group at the top, nervously negotiated the roundabout route to the bottom of Tunnel Creek. They could not catch up to Tim Wesley, but followed his snowboard track to the valley floor. It was 12:07 p.m. </p>
<p>They glided past the foot of a mound of chunky debris. One of the ravines had spewed a sizable avalanche, but there was no way to know it had occurred in the past few minutes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked up and I saw a ski pole sticking up,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;It looked like someone stuck it in there. It was sticking up right at the very end of the pile. Handle up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shouted to Pankey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Dude, you need to turn your transceiver on,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>There&rsquo;s people in here.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">Just after the avalanche, Ron Pankey and Tim Carlson discover the debris pile.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Carlson clicked out of his snowboard bindings and climbed onto the pile. Pankey turned his beacon to search mode. It beeped immediately.</p>
<p>His skis off, Pankey climbed onto the debris pile, too. <span class="nytmm_video_trigger">He saw the ski pole and two gloves</span>. He was sucker-punched by dread. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You figure someone who is fighting is going to have his gloves on,&rdquo; Pankey said. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re limp, yeah, their gloves are going to come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he noticed the brand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my thought &mdash; Oh, God, those are Scott gloves. Jim Jack was wearing Scott gloves,&rdquo; Pankey said.</p>
<p>Their beacons shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably searched for maybe a minute before I was on top of a signal,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;Your signal goes &lsquo;beepbeepbeepbeepbeep<span id="nytmm_beep" style="display:none"> - </span>BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP,&rsquo; and it gets a little fainter, like oh, over here. I got a strong signal, traversed over, got a weak signal, went back, got a strong signal, went back and I was basically on top of a body. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And, uh, the first shovel I dug in, I hit Jim Jack&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men dug frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Jim Jack&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;Eyes open, just staring at me. We could see he wasn&rsquo;t breathing. Ron started giving him breaths and I was searching for his body, underneath his chest. I was like, &lsquo;What the hell is going on?&rsquo; There was no body where you&rsquo;d expect a body to be. And then I started digging around, and I could see he was folded up into this ball. His feet were above his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His body had been pummeled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no blood, but he didn&rsquo;t have his helmet on, he didn&rsquo;t have his backpack on, his jacket was pulled over his head,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;He had some scrapes on his belly. And just pulling him out of the snow you could feel it and see it. Giving him a couple of breaths, it just came out so quick. And you push on his chest and it would just collapse. There was nothing there. And Jim Jack &mdash; we&rsquo;re all strong dudes, and there was just nothing left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pulled his arm upright, and it was just really soft,&rdquo; Carlson added. &ldquo;It was like pulling a wet towel. Pulled the other arm and it was the same feeling. And I pulled his legs out, and there was nothing connected to anything. It was completely crushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned off Jack&rsquo;s beacon and tried to lay him peacefully in the snow. Pankey pushed his eyelids closed.</p>

<div class="caption"><span>Ron Pankey</span> 12:31 PM</div>
</div>
<p>He called 911 at 12:31 p.m. and told the dispatcher that he had &ldquo;recovered a body.&rdquo;</p><p>She asked him for his name.</p><p>&ldquo;Jim Jack,&rdquo; Pankey replied.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s phone chirped. It had survived the avalanche, and Pankey reached into Jack&rsquo;s pocket and pulled it out. It was a text message from Jack&rsquo;s girlfriend, Tiffany Abraham. Rumors of a big avalanche in Tunnel Creek had reached the base area of Stevens Pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;You OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pankey looked over at the ski pole sticking straight out of the snow. It looked familiar. Pankey had noticed it on the hike up the ridge to Cowboy Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s in front of me,&rdquo; Pankey said. &ldquo;He was hiking in front of me and Jim Jack was behind me, and he had these old Smith, corrective angle, curved poles. So I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Johnny&rsquo;s pole.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="nytmm_left_margin">&lsquo;It Was Just a Bad Dream&rsquo;</h3>
<p>At the upper end of the meadow, more than 100 yards away and out of sight, Elyse Saugstad waited in the silence, unable to move.</p>
<p>She did not know how long she had been frozen there &mdash; head pointed downhill, hands sticking out of the snow, face poking through the ice just enough to breathe and see the breaking clouds trailing the weekend&rsquo;s storm.</p>
<p>Her hip ached. Her mind wandered. She wondered who else was caught in the avalanche. She wondered who was left to rescue them.</p>
<p>She felt herself getting colder. Her pink mittens, like those of a child&rsquo;s, had strings that attached them to her jacket. When she had come to a stop, one of the mittens was on her hand. The other was off, hanging from her wrist.</p>
<p>Saugstad could not claw the hard-packed snow with her mittens on. She took them off and picked at the ice until her fingers ached. She put her mittens on again until they warmed up. </p>
<p>She had not spoken since the avalanche stopped. It had not occurred to her to cry for help. Someone would come. She hoped. </p>
<p>Finally, for the first time, she shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; she screamed.</p>
<p>The face of Wenzel Peikert startled her.</p>
<p>Among those who skied down the gully, Peikert arrived first to the avalanche&rsquo;s final resting place. The walls of the ravine slowly fell away and opened onto a wide, sloping meadow. It was covered by an enormous pile of chunky ice cubes, some fit for a cocktail glass, others the size of couches. The debris was filled with dirt, rocks and shredded tree parts.</p>
<p>It stretched about 150 yards down what remained of the slope. It was 10 or 20 feet tall, obstructing Peikert&rsquo;s view to the bottom. Peikert&rsquo;s beacon began its frantic chirping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started getting a signal,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;I marked it with one of my poles. That&rsquo;s what they teach, to mark where you start picking up a signal and keep working to where it gets stronger. I took my skis off because it was so hard to ski on that stuff. And as I got close to that signal, I saw two pink gloves sticking out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saugstad was about 20 feet downhill. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Her feet were into the snow and her head was downhill, but I saw two pink gloves and her face,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she uncovered her face or not, but it was just barely sticking out of the snow. And a little bit of orange from her backpack. I started digging her out, trying not to hurt her. I said, &lsquo;Are you O.K.?&rsquo; And she said: &lsquo;I think so. My leg&rsquo;s kind of hurt.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peikert pulled his shovel from his backpack and started to dig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a pause, really quickly, I thought to myself: she&rsquo;s alive, she&rsquo;s breathing, her face is out of the snow,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;I thought, let&rsquo;s go find others. But then I realized that more snow could come down. I found someone alive, and I needed to get her out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saugstad sensed his urgency. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When he started unburying me, he flung his shovel and it went flying down the hill so far that he couldn&rsquo;t stop and go get it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And so then he had to start digging me out with his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peikert hurried, knowing that others were likely buried nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was actually really hard to get out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of her skis had stayed on, so it had kind of locked her into the snow. Even a ski boot gets locked in. I dug to get her ski off. It probably took five minutes of digging to get her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Michelson and Abrams arrived from above. They found Peikert and Saugstad on their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t dawn on me that she had been buried,&rdquo; Michelson said. &ldquo;I was relieved she was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over several minutes, others trickled down from above. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we got to the bottom, when we got through the ravine and got to the mouth, I just remember saying, &lsquo;Oh, my God,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;Snow chunks the size of boulders. That&rsquo;s when I realized the magnitude of everything. It looked like a war zone. It was chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelson took charge as an impromptu site commander. No one was sure who was missing or how many victims there might be. Michelson used her beacon and pinpointed two spots for others to search, then continued sweeping the meadow to search for more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My numbers and directions were bouncing all over the place,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;But Megan comes up and hers was right on it. Mine is a little bit older, but I don&rsquo;t know why it was bouncing around. I started probing, and I hit a spot where there obviously was something other than snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peikert and Rob Castillo dug through the ice. It had been more than 30 minutes since the avalanche.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger">Johnny Brenan was discovered about three feet below the surface</span>. He had been buried a few feet from Saugstad all along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found his back first,&rdquo; Peikert said. &ldquo;His head was really bent under. I tried to dig a hole through his armpit, to his head, thinking I might be able to get his face turned to give him C.P.R. There was blood. His chin was split open. His helmet was pushed back onto the back of his head and was filled with snow. One leg was off in a weird position, like he had a broken femur or hip or something. I finally got him out. He was cold. Blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castillo, Brenan&rsquo;s longtime friend and ski partner, worked side by side with Peikert, at last getting his legs out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The muscles were just beat,&rdquo; Castillo said.</p>
<p>About 20 feet up the hill, Abrams, Wangen and Stifter zeroed in on a victim, too. It was the spot that Peikert had marked with his pole before he spotted Saugstad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were still searching for the lowest signal,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;And the lowest signal I got on the transceiver was 2.4, and it took me, like, half a second to realize, oh, that&rsquo;s six feet down because it&rsquo;s in meters. So I&rsquo;m like, all right, this is our lowest reading. And I think on our third probe we struck something. I told Dan and Tim, &lsquo;All right, get the shovels out,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span> and we started digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digging was nothing like scooping snow from a driveway. It was more like shoveling the chunky piles that snowplows leave along the side of a cleared highway, full of large pieces seemingly glued together.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nytmm_article last">
<div class="inner_article clearfix">
<div class="left">
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re big mounds of snow and they&rsquo;re like concrete,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;So you dig and dig, and then that person would rotate to the back and take a break and the guy who was second would start clearing snow out for the guy who is digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly exhausted, they rotated frequently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a bad dream,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;I was standing there holding my shovel that I never intended to use, except maybe to get my car out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, they reached a victim: Chris Rudolph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was lying facedown, so it was hard to get to his face,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;And it was hard because we couldn&rsquo;t move him because he was just encased in there. His feet were buried really deeply. Finally I was able to get to his face. His face was blue. And so finally I was like: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get his feet out! We&rsquo;ve got to get his feet out!&rsquo; That took another good couple of minutes to get his feet free. Then we gently pulled him out by his backpack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger graphic" data-trigger="bodies_graphic">Stifter performed C.P.R. on Rudolph: 2 breaths, 30 compressions, to the point of exhaustion</span>. </p>
<p>Saugstad called 911. It was 12:40 p.m.</p>
<div class="nytmm_audio">
<div class="nytmm_circleplayer" data-mp3="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/multimedia/bundles/projects/2012/AvalancheDeploy/elyse.mp3"></div>
<div class="caption"><span>Elyse Saugstad</span> 12:40 PM</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reporting an avalanche,&rdquo; she said, breathlessly. </p>
<p>Frantic voices behind her shouted encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! You can do it! Come on, buddy! Take a breath!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dispatcher said there were &ldquo;units on scene.&rdquo; Saugstad said they had not arrived and asked if they were coming by helicopter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, we do not have a helicopter yet in the area because of the avalanche risk,&rdquo; the dispatcher said.</p>
<p>Hammond was the last to arrive from above and took over trying to revive Rudolph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I definitely believed that there was a chance,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;My hope dissipated certainly after Joel got there and I was sitting there. We knew. We looked at each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty feet downhill, the huddle around Brenan slowly came to the same conclusion. Peikert had been performing C.P.R. for close to 30 minutes, with Castillo&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping for a miracle then,&rdquo; Castillo said. &ldquo;But I really kind of understood that he was probably dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s worth of adrenaline dissolved to disheartened shock. A few other skiers had happened upon the scene, but no rescue help had arrived. </p>
<p>Saugstad walked around dazed, wearing her deflated air bag &ldquo;like dead angel wings,&rdquo; Carlsen said. Castillo made his way to the bottom of the hill to learn that Jim Jack was dead, too. Erin Dessert, the snowboarder who had veered away from the group at the top, frightened by the direction everyone was headed, had cautiously made her way down and rediscovered the group. She cradled Rudolph&rsquo;s head as others tried their last attempts to resuscitate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chris Rudolph,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know? He&rsquo;s the knight in shining armor of Stevens Pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>aurie Brenan and Tiffany Abraham, Jack&rsquo;s girlfriend, were both in the Bull&rsquo;s Tooth Pub and Eatery, on the second level of the Granite Peaks Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Tiffany sitting at the bar, and I sat a few seats away,&rdquo; Brenan said. &ldquo;She says, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Jim yet.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Oh, he and Johnny did Tunnel Creek.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man next to Abraham, a neighbor from Leavenworth, overheard. There was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek, he said. Someone came into the restaurant a while ago and asked for volunteers to help search. </p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s heart sank. Normally a font of buoyant optimism, she had a sudden pang of dread. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I downed my cocktail because I knew I&rsquo;d need it,&rdquo; Abraham said. &ldquo;The bartender was telling a story, and I was trying to be polite and listen, but I knew I had to get out of there. I got my lunch boxed up and walked down to the ski patrol office. I took the elevator, and it was the slowest elevator in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could tell immediately that bad news was waiting. She spotted a friend who was on his way to the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He grabs my hand and I screamed at him,&rdquo; Abraham said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>What the hell is going on?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>They went into the ski patrol room, on the ground level on the backside of the lodge. Inside is a first-aid room with beds for injured skiers. Beyond is a ski patrol break room, a couch against one wall.</p>
<p>Anne Hessburg, Rudolph&rsquo;s girlfriend, was sitting there, balled up in tears. She had skied all morning with a friend and taken an early lunch at the Iron Goat pizzeria. She walked up to the slope-side cabin that Rudolph had provided to the journalists from Powder magazine. Hessburg stored skis there. A friend received a call while she was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone told him there was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek,&rdquo; Hessburg said. &ldquo;He told me, and my stomach immediately dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hessburg rushed to the ski patrol room. She could tell by the way people were moving that it was something serious. She could hear the squawks on the walkie-talkies. Someone told her only that Rudolph was probably involved, as if to break the emotional fall.</p>
<p>Brixey, the ski patrol manager, confirmed it. Rudolph was dead. That was about when Abraham walked into the patrol room with her friend, noticing a broken Hessburg on the couch. </p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s friend turned to her, looked her in the eyes, and told her about Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby girl, he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just lost my breath,&rdquo; Abraham said. &ldquo;I lost it. I couldn&rsquo;t even be in my skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurie Brenan had no premonition. She watched Abraham rush out of the restaurant at the news of an avalanche and casually followed a few minutes behind. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought everything was fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going over to ski patrol. I felt like Johnny was probably using his skills, digging somebody out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to stay out of the way as people hurried in and out of the patrol room. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I heard someone say something about Jim Jack, and I thought, oh my God, how can that be?&rdquo; Brenan said. &ldquo;I knew they were all in the same group. I start calling to see if I can get someone to get my kids safe, back to the R.V., and get them a snack and put on a movie or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenan spotted Brixey, the patrol manager and Monday night poker player, and waited for an opening to approach. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;So, Chris, there&rsquo;s been an avalanche in Tunnel Creek?<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Brenan said. &ldquo;And he said yes. Anyone hurt? He said yes. Is anyone dead? He said yes. And I said, &lsquo;Do I know these people?&rsquo; And he said yes. I said, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Johnny?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard.<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption"><span>Dispatcher to Ski Patrol</span> 1:01 PM</div>
</div>
<p>It was true. One 911 call from Tunnel Creek had reported the death of Jack. Another had reported the death of Rudolph. A third made mention of a third fatality, but the dispatcher never asked the name. Brixey did not learn about Brenan until his own patrol members reached the scene. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I went outside, totally shaking,&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;I kept dropping my water bottle, again and again, because I was shaking so much. Then Chris Brixey comes and gets me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brixey&rsquo;s outward calm belied the turmoil inside. As a paramedic, he had told a lot of strangers that a loved one had died. But never a close friend. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That was, by far, the biggest challenge for me, walking Laurie from outside back to my office,&rdquo; Brixey said. &ldquo;Not knowing what I was going to say, but knowing what I had to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked past the empty beds, past Hessburg on the couch, past Abraham. In the office, he turned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Johnny was one of the people buried,&rdquo; Brenan said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>He didn&rsquo;t make it.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. I said, &lsquo;Have you seen him?&rsquo; He said no. I said: &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s possible he&rsquo;s not there. You go back and get more information because that is wrong. Go. Go find him. You&rsquo;re wrong.&rsquo; I remember thinking: He&rsquo;s got two kids. This was for fun. Johnny doesn&rsquo;t leave his responsibilities. Ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brixey left. Brenan melted into shock. Finally, a friend from Leavenworth came in. He had gone to Tunnel Creek about 20 minutes behind the large group and happened upon the scene. </p>
<p><span class="nytmm_video_trigger">&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I can tell you it was him</span>,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Laurie Brenan said. &ldquo;<span class="nytmm_single_quote left">&lsquo;</span>I gave him C.P.R. We tried.&rsquo;</p>

<!--SUB CHAPTER //-->
<h3>A Grim Vigil</h3>
<p>Back on the other side of Cowboy Mountain, and down a meadow that had been turned inside out, weary huddles surrounded three dead men. </p>
<p>Hope had surrendered. Rescues became grim vigils. The survivors did not know what to do other than wait. The bodies and faces of the victims were covered in jackets because it seemed the respectful thing to do. Survivors introduced themselves to those they had not met.</p>
<p>A group of 16 skiers and snowboarders, all of them experts, all of them unable to refuse the temptation of an hourlong excursion into steep powder, had been reduced by three lives. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so done with it,&rdquo; Stifter thought to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so done with skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first ski patrollers, along with an avalanche dog named Cava, arrived at 1:05 p.m., 70 minutes after the mountain gave way. They had started at the top and combed the entire path, following the funnel from the wide upper meadow through the flumelike ravine, searching for victims along the way. By the time they spit out of the mouth at the bottom, there was no rescue to be done. </p>
<p>The patrollers recognized faces in the huddles. They realized then that they had been searching for friends, not strangers. They stopped to find Rudolph and Brenan. Another patroller headed farther down to learn about Jack. </p>
<p>More patrollers began to arrive from below, on snowmobiles brought from the highway. A scene of quiet contemplation buzzed with activity and a second wave of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just became this sea, getting merged into everybody else&rsquo;s shock,&rdquo; Dessert said. &ldquo;When it was just us out there working on them, it seemed beautiful and spiritual, almost like an Indian burial ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="nytmm_inline float no_phone">

<div class="caption">Rescuers left their gear downhill as they prepared to take victims from the debris field to an awaiting Sno-Cat. The bodies were then transported about a half-mile to the highway. <span class="credit">Washington State Department of Transportation</span></div>
</div>
<p>The patrollers tried to revive the victims. It was useless.</p>
<p>A medical examiner determined that Jack&rsquo;s cause of death was &ldquo;subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage&rdquo; &mdash; brain trauma. She also diagnosed a partially torn aorta; a broken neck, vertebrae, sternum and ribs; and lacerations of the liver, spleen and pancreas. She described &ldquo;blunt force injury of the head, neck, torso and extremities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudolph, with a &ldquo;blunt force injury of the torso,&rdquo; sustained &ldquo;rib fractures with right hemothorax and probably compressional asphyxia.&rdquo; Brenan had &ldquo;blunt force injury and compression of the trunk,&rdquo; with &ldquo;multiple rib and vertebral fractures with probable compressional asphyxia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were probably dead by the time the avalanche stopped, or shortly after. </p>
<p>Brixey, working by radio over the mountain at Stevens Pass, told all rescue units to stand down. A second surge of patrollers would assist in taking the bodies off the mountain. </p>
<p>The survivors were encouraged to make their way to the highway, where ambulances awaited. Saugstad, missing a ski, used the one of Jack&rsquo;s that had been found. Hammond had been carrying it on his back. </p>
<p>Stifter and Carlsen sat on the meadow, unable to pull themselves away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody kind of skied down,&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;It seemed weird to me to leave the bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As with other survivors, the quarrel with their own guilt began immediately, the first sign that avalanches swallow more lives than just the ones buried beneath the snow. </p>
<p>They wondered if their mere presence at Stevens Pass that weekend gave rise to the Tunnel Creek trip, a group of proud locals eager to show off for influential out-of-towners. They wondered why they recognized all of the danger signs, starting with the avalanche report that morning over coffee, but did not do enough to slow or stop the expedition. They wondered if they could have saved lives after the avalanche by speeding to the bottom rather than combing the path. </p>
<p>They wondered how so many smart, experienced people could make the types of decisions that turned complex, rich, enviable lives into a growing stack of statistics.</p>
<p>Activity disturbed the quiet again. A Sno-Cat, a large machine with treads to climb through snow-covered terrain, rumbled through the trees below and parked at the bottom of the debris pile. Ski patrollers solemnly marched up the hill, carrying gear to wrap the bodies. </p>
<p>It was one deadly avalanche accident among many, perhaps no more worthy of attention than any other. It was not the nation&rsquo;s deadliest avalanche of the season. And it was not at all like the one that killed 96 people near Tunnel Creek more than a century ago.</p>
<p>But some rituals do not change. The accidents end with an unrefined ceremony.</p>
<p>Some patrollers stopped at Jack and wrapped him in a crude bundle using red blankets and rope. Others hiked to where Stifter and Carlsen sat. They wrapped the bodies of Brenan and Rudolph, with quiet expediency and reverence. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember they said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no easy way to do this,<span class="nytmm_single_quote">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Stifter said. &ldquo;And they started slowly dragging them down the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reporting for this article on the Feb. 19 avalanche at Tunnel Creek was done over six months. It involved interviews with every survivor, the families of the deceased, first responders at Tunnel Creek, officials at Stevens Pass and snow-science experts. It also included the examination of reports by the police, the medical examiner and the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, as well as 40 calls to 911 made in the aftermath of the avalanche. The Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research provided a computer-generated simulation of the avalanche, based on data accumulated from the Stevens Pass accident report and witness accounts. Additional sources are: LIDAR data from King County GIS Center; Iowa Environmental Mesonet, Iowa State University; Mark Moore, U.S. Forest Service; National Avalanche Center.</p>

Pot party planners are dreaming up classy events: the Colorado Symphony just had its first “Classically Cannabis” fund-raiser with joints and Debussy. But the state is also coming to grips with the darker side of unleashing a drug as potent as marijuana on a horde of tourists of all ages and tolerance levels seeking a mellow buzz.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="2686" itemprop="articleBody">In March, a 19-year-old Wyoming college student jumped off a Denver hotel balcony after eating a pot cookie with 65 milligrams of THC. In April, a Denver man ate pot-infused Karma Kandy and began talking like it was the end of the world, scaring his wife and three kids. Then he retrieved a handgun from a safe and killed his wife while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcher.</p><aside class="marginalia comments-marginalia  featured-comment-marginalia" data-marginalia-type="sprinkled" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-4">

John Hickenlooper and the Legislature recently created a task force to come up with packaging that clearly differentiates pot cookies and candy and gummy bears from normal sweets — with an eye toward protecting children — and directed the Department of Revenue to restrict the amount of edibles that can be sold at one time to one person.

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph top"><span class="pov_first_letter">S</span>he wakes to the sound of breathing. The smaller children lie tangled beside her, their chests rising and falling under winter coats and wool blankets. A few feet away, their mother and father sleep near the mop bucket they use as a toilet. Two other children share a mattress by the rotting wall where the mice live, opposite the baby, whose crib is warmed by a hair dryer perched on a milk crate. </p>

				<p>Slipping out from her covers, the oldest girl sits at the window. On mornings like this, she can see all the way across Brooklyn to the Empire State Building, the first New York skyscraper to reach 100 floors. Her gaze always stops at that iconic temple of stone, its tip pointed celestially, its facade lit with promise.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel like there&rsquo;s something going on out there,&rdquo; says the 11-year-old girl, never one for patience. This child of New York is always running before she walks. She likes being first &mdash; the first to be born, the first to go to school, the first to make the honor roll.</p>

				<p>Even her name, Dasani, speaks of a certain reach. The bottled water had come to Brooklyn&rsquo;s bodegas just before she was born, catching the fancy of her mother, who could not afford such indulgences. It hinted at a different, upwardly mobile clientele, a set of newcomers who over the next decade would transform the borough.</p>

				<p>Dasani&rsquo;s own neighborhood, Fort Greene, is now one of gentrification&rsquo;s gems. Her family lives in the Auburn Family Residence, a decrepit city-run shelter for the homeless. It is a place where mold creeps up walls and roaches swarm, where feces and vomit plug communal toilets, where sexual predators have roamed and small children stand guard for their single mothers outside filthy showers.</p>

				<p>It is no place for children. Yet Dasani is among 280 children at the shelter. Beyond its walls, she belongs to a vast and invisible tribe of more than 22,000 homeless children in New York, the highest number since the Great Depression, in the most unequal metropolis in America.</p>

				<p>Nearly a quarter of Dasani&rsquo;s childhood has unfolded at Auburn, where she shares a 520-square-foot room with her parents and seven siblings. As they begin to stir on this frigid January day, Dasani sets about her chores.</p>

				<p>Her mornings begin with Baby Lele, whom she changes, dresses and feeds, checking that the formula distributed by the shelter is not, once again, expired. She then wipes down the family&rsquo;s small refrigerator, stuffed with lukewarm milk, Tropicana grape juice and containers of leftover Chinese. After tidying the dresser drawers she shares with a sister, Dasani rushes her younger siblings onto the school bus.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I have a lot on my plate,&rdquo; she says, taking inventory: The fork and spoon are her parents and the macaroni, her siblings &mdash; except for Baby Lele, who is a plump chicken breast.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a lot on my plate &mdash; with some corn bread,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot on my plate.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani guards her feelings closely, dispensing with anger through humor. Beneath it all is a child whose existence is defined by her siblings. Her small scrub-worn hands are always tying shoelaces or doling out peanut butter sandwiches, taking the ends of the loaf for herself. The bond is inescapable. In the presence of her brothers and sisters, Dasani has no peace. Without them, she is incomplete.</p>

				<div id="part_1_single_9" class="pov_single_image"></div>

				<p>Today, Dasani rides the creaky elevator to the lobby and walks past the guards, the metal detector and the tall, iron fence that envelops what she calls &ldquo;the jail.&rdquo; She steps into the light, and is met by the worn brick facade of the Walt Whitman projects across the street.</p>

				<p>She heads east along Myrtle Avenue and, three blocks later, has crossed into another New York: the shaded, graceful abode of Fort Greene&rsquo;s brownstones, which fetch millions of dollars.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Black is beautiful, black is me,&rdquo; she sings under her breath as her mother trails behind.</p>

				<p> Dasani suddenly stops, puzzling at the pavement. Its condition, she notes, is clearly superior on this side of Myrtle.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Worlds change real fast, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; her mother says.</p>

				<p>In the short span of Dasani&rsquo;s life, her city has been reborn. The skyline soars with luxury towers, beacons of a new gilded age. More than 200 miles of fresh bike lanes connect commuters to high-tech jobs, passing through upgraded parks and avant-garde projects like the High Line and Jane&rsquo;s Carousel. Posh retail has spread from its Manhattan roots to the city&rsquo;s other boroughs. These are the crown jewels of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg&rsquo;s long reign, which began just seven months after Dasani was born.</p>

				<p>In the shadows of this renewal, it is Dasani&rsquo;s population who have been left behind. The ranks of the poor have risen, with almost half of New Yorkers living near or below the poverty line. Their traditional anchors &mdash; affordable housing and jobs that pay a living wage &mdash; have weakened as the city reorders itself around the whims of the wealthy.</p>

				<p>Long before Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio rose to power by denouncing the city&rsquo;s inequality, children like Dasani were being pushed further into the margins, and not just in New York. Cities across the nation have become flash points of polarization, as one population has bounced back from the recession while another continues to struggle. One in five American children is now living in poverty, giving the United States the highest child poverty rate of any developed nation except for Romania.</p>

				<p>This bodes poorly for the future. Decades of research have shown the staggering societal costs of children in poverty. They grow up with less education and lower earning power. They are more likely to have drug addiction, psychological trauma and disease, or wind up in prison.</p>

				<p>Dasani does not need the proof of abstract research. All of these plights run through her family. Her future is further threatened by the fact of her homelessness, which has been shown, even in short spells, to bring disastrous consequences.</p>

				<p>Dasani&rsquo;s circumstances are largely the outcome of parental dysfunction. While nearly one-third of New York&rsquo;s homeless children are supported by a working adult, her mother and father are unemployed, have a history of arrests and are battling drug addiction.</p>

				<p>Yet Dasani&rsquo;s trials are not solely of her parents&rsquo; making. They are also the result of decisions made a world away, in the marble confines of City Hall. With the economy growing in 2004, the Bloomberg administration adopted sweeping new policies intended to push the homeless to become more self-reliant. They would no longer get priority access to public housing and other programs, but would receive short-term help with rent. Poor people would be empowered, the mayor argued, and homelessness would decline.</p>

				<p> But the opposite happened. As rents steadily rose and low-income wages stagnated, chronically poor families like Dasani&rsquo;s found themselves stuck in a shelter system with fewer exits. Families are now languishing there longer than ever &mdash; a development that Mr. Bloomberg explained by saying shelters offered &ldquo;a much more pleasurable experience than they ever had before.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Just three days before the mayor made that comment at a news conference in August 2012, an inspector at Auburn stopped by Dasani&rsquo;s crowded room, noting that a mouse was &ldquo;running around and going into the walls,&rdquo; which had &ldquo;many holes.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Please assist,&rdquo; the inspector added. &ldquo;There is infant in room.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani was about to start sixth grade at a promising new school. This would be a pivotal year of her childhood &mdash; one already marked by more longing and loss than most adults ever see.</p>

				<p>A tangle of three dramas had yet to unspool.</p>

				<p>There was the question of whether Dasani&rsquo;s family would remain intact. Her mother had just been reunited with the children on the condition that she and her husband stay off drugs. The city&rsquo;s Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services was watching closely. Any slips, and the siblings could wind up in foster care, losing their parents and, most likely, one another.</p>

				<p>The family&rsquo;s need for a home was also growing desperate. The longer they stayed in that one room, the more they seemed to fall apart. Yet rents were impossibly high in the city, and a quarter-million people were waiting for the rare vacancy in public housing. Families like Dasani&rsquo;s had been leaving the state. This was the year, then, that her parents made a promise: to save enough money to go somewhere else, maybe as far as the Pocono Mountains, in Pennsylvania. </p>

				<p>Dasani could close her eyes and see it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet and it&rsquo;s a lot of grass.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>In the absence of this long-awaited home, there was only school. But it remained to be seen whether Dasani&rsquo;s new middle school, straining under budget cuts, could do enough to fill the voids of her life.</p>

				<p>For children like Dasani, school is not just a place to cultivate a hungry mind. It is a refuge. The right school can provide routine, nourishment and the guiding hand of responsible adults.</p>

				<p>But school also had its perils. Dasani was hitting the age when girls prove their worth through fighting. And she was her mother&rsquo;s daughter, a fearless fighter.</p>

				<p>She was also on the cusp of becoming something more, something she could feel but not yet see, if only the right things happened and the right people came along. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani is a short, wiry girl whose proud posture overwhelms her 4-foot-8 frame. She has a delicate, oval face and luminous brown eyes that watch everything, owl-like. Her expression veers from wonder to mischief. Strangers often remark on her beauty &mdash; her high cheekbones and smooth skin &mdash; but the comments never seem to register.</p>

				<p>What she knows is that she has been blessed with perfect teeth. In a family where braces are the stuff of fantasy, having good teeth is a lottery win.</p>

				<p>On the subway, Dasani can blend in with children who are better off. It is an ironic fact of being poor in a rich city that the donated garments Dasani and her siblings wear lend them the veneer of affluence, at least from a distance. Used purple Uggs and Patagonia fleeces cover thinning socks and fraying jeans. A Phil & Teds rain cover, fished from a garbage bin, protects Baby Lele&rsquo;s rickety stroller.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_1_single_5"></div>

				<p>Dasani tells herself that brand names don&rsquo;t matter. She knows such yearnings will go unanswered, so better not to have them. But once in a while, when by some miracle her mother produces a new pair of Michael Jordan sneakers, Dasani finds herself succumbing to the same exercise: She wears them sparingly, and only indoors, hoping to keep them spotless. It never works.</p>

				<p>Best to try to blend in, she tells herself, while not caring when you don&rsquo;t.</p>

				<p>She likes being small because &ldquo;I can slip through things.&rdquo; In the blur of her city&rsquo;s crowded streets, she is just another face. What people do not see is a homeless girl whose mother succumbed to crack more than once, whose father went to prison for selling drugs, and whose cousins and aunts have become the anonymous casualties of gang shootings, AIDS and domestic violence.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not gonna be me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Nuh-uh. Nope.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani speaks with certainty. She often begins a sentence with &ldquo;Mommy say&rdquo; before reciting, verbatim, some new bit of learned wisdom, such as &ldquo;camomile tea cures a bad stomach&rdquo; or &ldquo;that lady is a dope fiend.&rdquo; She likes facts. She rarely wavers, or hints at doubt, even as her life is consumed by it.</p>

				<p>When strangers are near, Dasani refers to Auburn as &ldquo;that place.&rdquo; It is separate from her, and distant. But in the company of her siblings, she calls it &ldquo;the house,&rdquo; transforming a crowded room into an imaginary home.</p>

				<p>In reality, Auburn is neither. The forbidding, 10-story brick building, which dates back almost a century, was formerly Cumberland Hospital, one of seven public hospitals that closed because of the city&rsquo;s 1970s fiscal crisis. </p>

				<p>In 1985, the city repurposed the former hospital into a shelter for families. This was the dawn of the period known as &ldquo;modern homelessness,&rdquo; driven by wage stagnation, Reagan-era cutbacks and the rising cost of homes. By the time Mayor Bloomberg took office in 2002, New York&rsquo;s homeless population had reached 31,063 &mdash; a record for the city, which is legally obligated to provide shelter.</p>

				<p>Among the city&rsquo;s 152 family shelters, Auburn became known as a place of last resort, a dreaded destination for the chronically homeless.</p>

				<p>City and state inspectors have repeatedly cited the shelter for deplorable conditions, including sexual misconduct by staff members, spoiled food, asbestos exposure, lead paint and vermin. Auburn has no certificate of occupancy, as required by law, and lacks an operational plan that meets state regulations. Most of the shelter&rsquo;s smoke detectors and alarms have been found to be inoperable.</p>

				<p>There are few signs that children live at Auburn. Locked gates prevent them from setting foot on the front lawn. In a city that has invested millions of dollars in new &ldquo;green spaces,&rdquo; Auburn&rsquo;s is often overrun with weeds. </p>

				<p>Inside, prepackaged meals are served in a cafeteria where Dasani and her siblings wait in one line for their food before heading to another line to heat it in one of two microwaves that hundreds of residents share. Tempers fly and fights explode. The routine can last more than an hour before the children take their first bite. </p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>The family&rsquo;s room is the scene of debilitating chaos: stacks of dirty laundry, shoes stuffed under a mattress, bicycles and coats piled high. To the left of the door, beneath a decrepit sink where Baby Lele is bathed, the wall has rotted through, leaving a long, dark gap where mice congregate.</p>

				<p>A few feet away, Dasani&rsquo;s legally blind, 10-year-old sister, Nijai, sleeps on a mattress that has come apart at the seams, its rusted coils splayed. </p>
				</span>

				<p>Hand-washed clothes line the guards on the windows, which are shaded by gray wool blankets strung from the ceiling. A sticky fly catcher dangles overhead, dotted with dead insects. </p>

				<p>There is no desk or chair in the room &mdash; just a maze of mattresses and dressers. A flat-screen television rests on two orange milk crates.</p>

				<p>To eat, the children sit on the cracked linoleum floor, which never feels clean no matter how much they mop. Homework is a challenge. The shelter&rsquo;s one recreation room can hardly accommodate Auburn&rsquo;s hundreds of children, leaving Dasani and her siblings to study, hunched over, on their mattresses.</p>

				<p>Sometimes it feels like too many bodies sharing the same air. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no space to breathe &rsquo;cause they breathe up all the oxygen,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>She carves out small, sacred spaces: a portion of the floor at mealtime, an upturned crate by the window, a bathroom stall. </p>

				<p>The children spend hours at the playgrounds of the surrounding housing projects, where a subtle hierarchy is at work. If they are seen enough times emerging from Auburn, they are pegged as the neighborhood&rsquo;s outliers, the so-called shelter boogies. </p>

				<p>Nothing gnaws at Dasani more.</p>

				<p>A mucus-stained nose suggests a certain degradation, not just the absence of tissues, but of a parent willing to wipe or a home so unclean that a runny nose makes no difference. Dasani and her siblings can get hungry enough to lose their concentration in school, but they are forever wiping one another&rsquo;s noses. </p>

				<p>When Dasani hears &ldquo;shelter boogies,&rdquo; all she can think to say is what her mother always tells her &mdash; that Auburn is &ldquo;just a pit stop.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;But you will live in the projects forever, as will your kids&rsquo; kids, and your kids&rsquo; kids&rsquo; kids.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>She knows the battle is asymmetrical. </p>

				<p>The projects may represent all kinds of inertia. But to live at Auburn is to admit the ultimate failure: the inability of one&rsquo;s parents to meet that most basic need.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani ticks through their faces, the girls from the projects who might turn up at this new school. Some are kind enough not to gossip about where she lives.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;The others might be distracted by the sheer noise of this first day &mdash; the start of sixth grade, the new uniform, the new faces. She will hopefully slip by those girls unseen.</p>

				<p>She approaches the school&rsquo;s steps on a clear September morning. Fresh braids fall to one side of her face, clipped by bright yellow bows. Her required polo and khakis have been pressed with a hair straightener, since Auburn forbids irons.</p>

				<p>Her heart is pounding. She will be sure to take a circuitous route home. She will focus in class and mind her manners in the schoolyard. She only has to climb those steps.</p>

				<p>Minutes pass.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Come on, there&rsquo;s nothing to be scared about,&rdquo; her 34-year-old mother, Chanel, finally says, nudging Dasani up the stairs.</p>

				<p>She passes through the metal detector, joining 507 other middle and high school students at the Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts. </p>

				<p>Housed in a faded brick building two blocks from Auburn, McKinney is a poor-kids&rsquo; version of LaGuardia Arts, the elite Manhattan public school that inspired the television series &ldquo;Fame.&rdquo; Threadbare curtains adorn its theater. Stage props are salvaged from a nearby trash bin. Dance class is so crowded that students practice in intervals.</p>

				<p>An air of possibility permeates the school, named after the first African-American woman to become a physician in New York State.</p>

				<p>There is Officer Jamion Andrews, the security guard who moonlights as a rap lyricist, and Zakiya Harris, the dance teacher who runs a studio on the side. And there is Faith Hester, the comedic, eyelash-batting humanities teacher who wrote a self-help book titled &ldquo;Create a Life You Love Living&rdquo; and fancies her own reality show. </p>

				<p>The children also strive. Among them is a voice that periodically lifts the school with a &ldquo;Madama Butterfly&rdquo; aria. When the students hear it, they know that Jasmine, a sublimely gifted junior, is singing in the office of the principal, Paula Holmes.</p>

				<p>The school matriarch closes her eyes as she listens. It may be her only tranquil moment.</p>

				<p>Miss Holmes is a towering woman, by turns steely and soft. She wears a Bluetooth like a permanent earring and tends toward power suits. She has been at McKinney&rsquo;s helm for 15 years and runs the school like a naval ship, peering down its gleaming hallways as if searching the seas for enemy vessels.</p>

				<p>Students stammer in her presence. She leaves her office door permanently open, like a giant, unblinking eye. A poster across the hall depicts a black man in sagging jeans standing before the White House, opposite President Obama. &ldquo;To live in this crib,&rdquo; the poster reads, &ldquo;you have to look the part.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Miss Holmes has no tolerance for sagging &mdash; sartorial, attitudinal or otherwise.</p>

				<p>McKinney&rsquo;s roots run deep. Dasani&rsquo;s own grandmother studied there as a girl. Most of the middle school students are black, live in the surrounding projects and qualify for free or reduced meals. They eat in shifts in the school&rsquo;s basement cafeteria, watched over by the avuncular Frank Heyward, who blasts oldies from a boombox, telling students, &ldquo;I got shoes older than you.&rdquo; </p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_1_single_3"></div>

				<p>For all of McKinney&rsquo;s pluck, its burdens are great. In the last six years, the city has cut the school&rsquo;s budget by a quarter as its population declined. Fewer teachers share a greater load. After-school resources have thinned, but not the needs of students whose families are torn apart by gun violence and drug use. McKinney&rsquo;s staff psychologist shuttles between three schools like a firefighter.</p>

				<p>And now, a charter school is angling to move in. If successful, it will eventually claim McKinney&rsquo;s treasured top floor, home to its theater class, dance studio and art lab. Teachers and parents are bracing for battle, announced by fliers warning against the &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; effects of a charter co-location. </p>

				<p>Dasani knows about charter schools. Her former school, P.S. 67, shared space with one. She never spoke to those children, whose classrooms were stocked with new computers. Dasani&rsquo;s own school was failing by the time she left.</p>

				<p>At McKinney, Dasani quickly draws the notice of the older students, and not because she is short, though the nickname &ldquo;Shorty&rdquo; sticks. It is her electricity. When they dote on her, she giggles. But say the wrong thing and she turns fierce, letting the four-letter words fly.</p>

				<p>It is still September when Dasani&rsquo;s temper lands her in the principal&rsquo;s office. </p>

				<p> &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t call my mother,&rdquo; Dasani whispers.</p>

				<p>Miss Holmes is seated in a rolling pleather chair held together by duct tape. She stares at the anguished girl. She has been at McKinney long enough to know when a child&rsquo;s transgressions at school might bring a beating at home.</p>

				<p>The principal slowly scoots her chair up to Dasani and leans within inches of her face.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; she says softly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a deal.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>From that day forward, Dasani will be on her best behavior. In turn, Miss Holmes will keep what happens at school in school. </p>

				<p>With that, she waves Dasani off, fighting the urge to smile. She can&rsquo;t help but like this feisty little girl.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani closes her eyes and tilts her head toward the ceiling of her classroom. She has missed breakfast again.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;She tries to drift. She sees Florida. For a child who has never been to the beach, television ads are transporting. She is walking in the sand. She crashes into the waves.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Dasaaaaaani!&rdquo; her teacher sings out.</p>

				<p>She opens her eyes. </p>

				<p>There is Miss Hester, batting those lashes.</p>

				<p>Both she and another teacher, Kenya Mabry, were raised in the projects. They dress and talk with a polish that impresses Dasani, who studies them.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_1_single_4"></div>

				<p>Miss Hester is also watching Dasani. She does not yet know where Dasani lives, or how hungry she gets. But Miss Hester finds two things striking: how late she arrives some mornings and how capable this girl is in spite of it. Without even trying, she keeps up.</p>

				<p>Dasani possesses what adults at McKinney consider an intuitive approach to learning, the kind that comes when rare smarts combine with extreme life circumstances. Her intelligence is &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; and &ldquo;far surpasses peers her age,&rdquo; one counselor writes. &ldquo;Student is continuously using critical analysis to reflect upon situations and interactions.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Principal Holmes is also taking note. She can already see in this &ldquo;precocious little button&rdquo; the kind of girl who could be anything &mdash; even a Supreme Court justice &mdash; if only she harnesses her gifts early enough. &ldquo;Dasani has something that hasn&rsquo;t even been unleashed yet,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still being cultivated.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>For now, Dasani&rsquo;s most honed skill might be obfuscation. She works hard to hide her struggles, staying quiet as other children brag about their new cellphones or sleepovers with friends.</p>

				<p> If there is one place she feels free, it is dance class. When she walks into McKinney&rsquo;s studio, and the music starts, her body releases whatever she is feeling. </p>

				<p> &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m happy I dance fast,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m sad I dance slow. When I&rsquo;m upset I dance both.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani has been dancing for as long as she can remember, well before she earned her first dollar a few years ago break-dancing in Times Square. But the study of dance, as something practiced rather than spontaneous, this is new. She is learning to point her toes like a ballerina, and to fall back into a graceful bridge. </p>

				<p>Perhaps it is no accident that amid the bedlam of Dasani&rsquo;s home life &mdash; the missed welfare appointments and piles of unwashed clothes &mdash; she is drawn to a craft of discipline. </p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>Here, in this room, time is kept and routines are mapped with precision and focus.</p>

				<p>Dasani never tires of rehearsing the same moves, or scrutinizing more experienced dancers. Her gaze is often fixed on a tall, limber eighth grader named Sahai.</p>
				</span>

				<p>Sahai is the middle school&rsquo;s valedictorian. A breathtaking dancer, she has long silky hair and carries herself like a newly crowned queen. She is a girl with enough means to accessorize elegantly. When Dasani looks at Sahai, she is taking the measure of all she is not. </p>

				<p>You can be popular in one of three ways, Dasani&rsquo;s mother always says. Dress fly. Do good in school. Fight.</p>

				<p>The first option is out of the question. While Dasani clings to her uniform, other students wear coveted Adidas hoodies and Doc Marten boots. In dance class, Dasani does not even have a leotard. </p>

				<p>So she applies herself in school. &ldquo;I have a lot of possibility,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>Her strongest subject is English, where a poem she writes is tacked to a teacher&rsquo;s wall. </p>

				<p>By October, she is on the honor roll, just as her life at Auburn is coming apart.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">I</span>t is something of an art to sleep among nine other people. One learns not to hear certain sounds or smell certain smells.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;But some things still intrude on Dasani&rsquo;s sleep. There is the ceaseless drip of that decaying sink, and the scratching of hungry mice. It makes no difference when the family lays out traps and hangs its food from the ceiling in a plastic bag. Auburn&rsquo;s mice always return, as stubborn as the &ldquo;ghetto squirrels,&rdquo; in Chanel&rsquo;s lingo, that forage the trash for Chinese fried chicken.</p>

				<p>Dasani shares a twin mattress and three dresser drawers with her mischievous and portly sister, Avianna, only one year her junior. Their 35-year-old stepfather, Supreme, has raised them as his own. They consider him their father and call him Daddy.</p>

				<p>Supreme married Chanel nine years earlier, bringing two children from a previous marriage. The boy, Khaliq, had trouble speaking. He had been trapped with his dead, pregnant mother after she fell down a flight of stairs. The girl, Nijai, had a rare genetic eye disease and was going blind. They were the same tender ages as Dasani and Avianna, forming a homeless Brady Bunch as Supreme and Chanel had four more children. </p>

				<p>Two of Dasani&rsquo;s half-sisters, 7-year-old Maya and 6-year-old Hada, share the mattress to her right. The 5-year-old they call Papa sleeps by himself because he wets the bed. In the crib is Baby Lele, who is tended to by Dasani when her parents are listless from their daily dose of methadone.</p>

				<p>Chanel and Supreme take the synthetic opioid as part of their drug treament program. It has essentially become a substitute addiction.</p>

				<p>The more time they spend in this room, the smaller it feels. Nothing stays in order. Everything is exposed &mdash; marital spats, frayed underwear, the onset of puberty, the mischief other children hide behind closed doors. Supreme paces erratically. Chanel cannot check her temper. For Dasani and her siblings, to act like rambunctious children is to risk a beating.</p>

				<!--COLLAGE OF KIDS-->
				<div class="pov_image_collage clearfix" id="part_1_collage_kids"></div>

				<p>By late fall, Chanel and Supreme are fighting daily about money.</p>

				<p>It has been years since Supreme lost his job as a barber and Chanel stopped working as a janitor for the parks department. He cuts hair inside the shelter and sells pirated DVDs on the street while she hawks odds and ends from discount stores. In a good month, their combined efforts can bring in a few hundred dollars.</p>

				<p>This is not one of those times. Supreme is keeping tight control of the family&rsquo;s welfare income &mdash; $1,285 in food stamps and $1,122 in survivor benefits for his first wife&rsquo;s death. He refuses to give Chanel cash for laundry. </p>

				<p>Soon, all of Dasani&rsquo;s uniforms are stained. At school, she is now wearing donated clothes and her hair is unkempt, inviting the dreaded designation of &ldquo;nappy.&rdquo; Rumors are circulating about where she lives. Only six of the middle school&rsquo;s 157 students reside in shelters. </p>

				<p>When the truth about Dasani emerges, she does nothing to contradict it. She is a proud girl. She must find a way to turn the truth, like other unforeseeable calamities, in her favor.</p>

				<p>She begins calling herself &ldquo;ghetto.&rdquo; She dares the girls to fight her and challenges the boys to arm-wrestle, flexing the biceps she has built doing pull-ups in Fort Greene Park. The boys watch slack-jawed as Dasani demonstrates the push-ups she has also mastered, earning her the nickname &ldquo;muscle girl.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>Her teachers are flummoxed. They assume that she has shed her uniform because she is trying to act tough. In fact, the reverse is true.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">A</span> chilly, November wind whips across Auburn Place, rustling the plastic cover of a soiled mattress in a trash bin outside the shelter.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Chanel and Supreme stand nearby, waiting for their children to come from school. They are still short on cash. The children had pitched in $5.05, from collecting cans and bottles over the weekend.</p>

				<p>Chanel inspects the mattress. Clean, it might fetch $10. But it is stained with feces. Janitors wearing masks and gloves had removed it from a squalid room where three small children lived, defecating on the floor. Their mother rarely bathed them, and they had no shoes on the day she gathered them in a hurry and left.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You can smell it?&rdquo; Chanel asks Supreme. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;No, I can see it,&rdquo; he says, curling his lip.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Those are the people that they need to be calling A.C.S. on,&rdquo; Chanel says. At the shelter, the abbreviation for the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services is uttered with the same kind of alarm that the C.I.A. can stoke overseas.</p>

				<p>Everyone knows Chanel. She weighs 215 pounds and her face is a constellation of freckles lit by a gaptoothed smile. </p>
				</span>

				<p>She wraps her copper-hued hair in a tubular scarf. The street is her domain. When she walks, people often step to the side &mdash; not in deference to her ample frame so much as her magisterial air. </p>

				<p>Chanel is in everyone&rsquo;s business, scoping out snitches, offering homeopathic remedies, tattling on a girl&rsquo;s first kiss. A five-minute walk through Fulton Mall can take Chanel hours for all the greetings, gossip, recriminations and nostalgia. She has a remarkable nose for people, sniffing out phoniness in seconds. Those who smile too much are wearing &ldquo;a frown turned upside down.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She is often spoiling for a fight, or leaving people in the stitches of laughter. While others want the life of the music mogul Jay-Z, Chanel would settle for being his pet. &ldquo;Just let me be the dog. I don&rsquo;t care where you put me.&rdquo; When Chanel laughs, she tilts her head back and unleashes a thunderous cackle.</p>

				<p>Dasani can detect her mother&rsquo;s laugh from blocks away. Today, she returns from school lugging a plastic bag of clothes donated by a security guard at McKinney.</p>

				<p>Dasani begins rummaging through the bag. She pulls out a white Nautica ski jacket and holds it up to her shoulders. It is too wide, but she likes it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dirty,&rdquo; she says forgivingly. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Look, Mommy!&rdquo; she says, modeling her new coat.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That fits you real nice,&rdquo; Chanel coos.</p>

				<p>Suddenly, Supreme leaps into the air. His monthly benefits have arrived, announced by a recording on his prepaid welfare phone. He sets off to reclaim his gold teeth from the pawnshop and buy new boots for the children at Cookie&rsquo;s, a favored discount store in Fulton Mall. The money will be gone by week&rsquo;s end.</p>

				<p>Supreme and Chanel have been scolded about their lack of financial discipline in countless meetings with the city agencies that monitor the family. </p>

				<p>But when that monthly check arrives, Supreme and Chanel do not think about abstractions like &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-reliance.&rdquo; They lose themselves in the delirium that a round of ice creams brings. They feel the sudden, exquisite release born of wearing those gold fronts again &mdash; of appearing like a person who has rather than a person who lacks. </p>

				<p>The next day, Dasani goes to school wearing her new Cookie&rsquo;s boots. Feeling amped, she gets into a verbal spat with some boys in gym class and must spend her lunch hour in the principal&rsquo;s office. </p>

				<p>Miss Holmes glowers at Dasani, who tries to leaven the mood by bragging about her place on the honor roll. The principal is unmoved. Dasani still has a B average. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;I want the highest end of the honor roll,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;I want more. You have to want more, too.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani stares at her tray. The discussion returns to her behavior in gym class.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;While we care for you, we&rsquo;re not going to take any crap,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Trying not to cry, Dasani examines her food &mdash; a slice of cheese pizza, chocolate milk, a red apple. She wrinkles her nose. Miss Holmes has seen it before, the child too proud to show hunger.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;Can you hurry up?&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;The drama with the pizza is not working for me.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Silence.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feed you,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;I will feed you. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll feed you? Bring the tray.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani slowly lifts the pizza slice to her mouth, cracking a smile.</p>

				<p>Miss Holmes has seen plenty of distressed children, but few have both the depth of Dasani&rsquo;s troubles and the height of her promise. There is not much Miss Holmes can do about life outside school. She knows this is a child who needs a sponsor, who &ldquo;needs to see &lsquo;The Nutcracker,&rsquo;&rdquo; who needs her own computer. There are many such children. </p>

				<p>Here at school, Miss Holmes must work with what she has.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Apples are very good for you,&rdquo; she says, smiling. &ldquo;Bananas are, too.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like those,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Pretend you like them.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>When Dasani is finished, she brings her empty tray to the principal for inspection. Miss Holmes gestures at Dasani&rsquo;s milk-stained mouth.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Fix it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">T</span>he tree is covered in Christmas lights that mask the lack of ornaments.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;The children gather around it inside a dilapidated, two-story rowhouse in East New York, Brooklyn &mdash; the closest thing they have to a home. It belongs to Chanel&rsquo;s ailing godmother, Sherry, whom the children call Grandma. </p>

				<p>Sherry&rsquo;s day care center once occupied the first floor, where fading decals of Bambi now share space with empty liquor bottles. Chanel&rsquo;s two unemployed brothers, 22-year-old Josh and 39-year-old Lamont, stay in the dark, musty basement. When the children visit, they spend most of their time upstairs, sleeping on a drafty wooden floor beneath a Roman-numeral clock that is permanently stopped at 2:47.</p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>Sherry&rsquo;s electricity has been cut, but the tree remains lit and the heat stays on, via a cable illicitly connected to a neighbor&rsquo;s power supply.</p>

				<p>Christmas gifts are scarce: coloring books, a train set, stick-on tattoos, one doll for each girl.</p>
				</span>

				<p>A few nights later, the children are roused by shouts and a loud crash. Uncle Josh has punched his hand through a window and is threatening to kill Uncle Lamont.</p>

				<p>Josh lunges at his brother with a knife. The men tumble to the floor as Chanel throws herself between them. Upstairs, the children cower and scream. </p>

				<p>Dasani calls out orders: &ldquo;Nobody move! Let the adults handle it!&rdquo; </p>

				<p>Sirens rattle the block. Josh is taken away in handcuffs as an ambulance races Lamont to the hospital with a battered eye. They had been fighting over a teenage girl. </p>

				<p>January brings relief, but not because of the new year. It is the start of tax season, when Dasani&rsquo;s parents &mdash; and everyone they seem to know &mdash; rush to file for the earned-income tax credit, a kind of bonanza for the poor. </p>

				<p>Their tax refunds can bring several thousand dollars, which could be enough to put down a rent deposit and leave the shelter.</p>

				<p>On Jan. 7, the family heads to Manhattan for a rare outing. They take the Q train, which barrels high across the East River. The city&rsquo;s lights shimmer, making Chanel think of opportunity. </p>

				<p>They will start looking for a home soon, she says.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;I wanna go somewhere where it&rsquo;s quiet,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I wanna go somewhere where there&rsquo;s trees,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;I just wanna see a bunch of trees and grass.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Daddy say that he gonna buy this house with a lot of land with grass,&rdquo; Dasani says, &ldquo;so that each of us would get a part, so that you can do whatever you want with that part of the land.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Supreme sits far-off, listening to music on his phone. Baby Lele wails.</p>

				<p>Suddenly, Chanel spots Chinatown. The children squeal. Dasani mentions a book she read about the Great Wall of China.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not this town,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big wall though,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the real Chinatown,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;This is the New York Chinatown, where they got Chinese people in Popeyes.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani presses her forehead against the window and cups her hands around her eyes, as if preserving the view for herself.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">O</span>pportunity comes rarely, but Dasani is always waiting. She wakes early on Jan. 18, hours in advance of a track competition known for rescuing girls from the ghetto.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;She has no running shoes, just a pair of imitation Converses. She is unknown in the rarefied world of athletic recruiters and private coaches. But ask anyone in her small corner of Brooklyn, from the crossing guards to the drunks, and they will say two things about this tiny girl with the wayward braids: She is strong like a boy and can run like the wind.</p>

				<p>Dasani heads out in the icy cold with her mother and two of her sisters. They walk a mile before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Pratt Institute in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Clinton Hill, which is hosting the Colgate Women&rsquo;s Games. </p>

				<p>The amateur track and field series is a magnet for athletic recruiters, and some of its champions have gone as far as the Olympics. Dasani will compete in the 200-meter dash. She heads to the bathroom to change.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She got shorts to put on?&rdquo; one of the organizers asks.</p>

				<p>Dasani reaches for her leggings.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Those are the sneakers?&rdquo; the woman frowns.</p>

				<p>Wearing no socks, Dasani ties her rainbow laces and walks to the track. When her number is called, she takes her place among four other girls. </p>

				<p>The blank fires and she is off, ahead of the pack.</p>

				<p>Win, Dasani tells herself. Win.</p>

				<p>At the first bend, she trips and falls behind. </p>

				<p>By the second turn, Dasani has caught up with the lead runner. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Run, Dasani!&rdquo; Chanel screams. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>They are in a dead heat for the finish line. </p>

				<p>Dasani comes in second. It hardly matters that her time is insufficient to make it past the preliminaries. They leave the stadium feeling euphoric.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;My baby&rsquo;s going to the Olympics,&rdquo; Chanel crows. As they walk west along Willoughby Avenue, they talk of finding a trainer. Chanel starts singing her favorite Luther Vandross song, &ldquo;A House Is Not a Home.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>The girls have heard it enough times to sing along.</p>

				<p class="lines">A chair is still a chair</p>
				<p class="lines">Even when there&rsquo;s no one sittin&rsquo; there</p>
				<p class="lines">But a chair is not a house</p>
				<p class="lines">And a house is not a home</p>
				<p class="lines">When there&rsquo;s no one there </p>
				<p class="lines nobotmarg">to hold you tight.</p>

				<p>They turn north on Carlton Avenue, passing a renovated brick townhouse with sleek, metal window frames.</p>

				<p>A skinny brunette is unloading her station wagon. At the sight of Dasani&rsquo;s family, she freezes. She smiles nervously and moves slowly to her car, grabbing an infant from the car seat.</p>

				<p>The mood shifts.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She thinks we gonna jump her,&rdquo; Chanel says as she keeps walking. The shelter is only three blocks away. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Why do they feel like they&rsquo;re so apart? She&rsquo;s just two steps away from us. If you got jumped out here, a black man would be the first to save your ass. That&rsquo;s what I feel like telling her.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>When they reach Myrtle Avenue, Chanel goes searching for a beer at her favorite corner store. Dasani trails her. </p>

				<p>Inside, the short-order cook, a Mexican girl, stares at Chanel suspiciously.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You so nice, that&rsquo;s why I see you,&rdquo; the girl responds cockily.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You better watch that grill,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to scare you.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>&ldquo;You think you scare me?&rdquo; the girl yells.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fight right now!&rdquo; Chanel shouts.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Wait for me outside!&rdquo; the girl calls back.</p>

				<p>Chanel moves toward her, reaching for a mop.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Mommy!&rdquo; Dasani screams.</p>

				<p>The owner, Salim, races toward Chanel.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll crack her with a stick!&rdquo; Chanel yells as Salim holds her back. </p>

				<p>Dasani is frozen.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ma wait for your ass when you come out,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;What time she get off?&rdquo; </p>

				<p>&ldquo;You run your mouth,&rdquo; Salim says, gently leading Chanel away, as he has done before. </p>

				<p>As they leave, Dasani turns to the cook.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She gonna knock you stupid, Chinese lady,&rdquo; Dasani says. </p>

				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use those words,&rdquo; Salim cries out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to turn out like your mother.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph top"><span class="pov_first_letter">G</span>racie Mansion is something of an oddity. In a city with a 2 percent vacancy rate and a shortage of public housing, the mayoral residence sits uninhabited on 11 pristine acres of the Upper East Side.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;It has been more than a decade since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg chose to remain in his opulent townhouse, consigning Gracie Mansion to the status of a museum and venue for civic events.</p>

				<p>Dasani knows none of these particulars when she steps through Gracie&rsquo;s doors on a school trip in February. She is looking for the mayor. She wants to see him up close, this mysterious &ldquo;Wizard of Oz&rdquo; figure who makes decisions about her life from behind a curtain of political power.</p>

				<p>It never occurs to Dasani that the mayor does not live there. Who could have a mansion and not live in it?</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Look at that fireplace!&rdquo; she marvels as her classmates step into the parlor where Mr. Bloomberg has given news conferences. The tour guide, a woman wearing gold-clasp earrings and tangerine lipstick, moves the children along, reminding them not to touch.</p>

				<p>They shuffle into the library. Still no mayor. Dasani scans for clues like the F.B.I. agents of her favorite television show, &ldquo;Criminal Minds.&rdquo; She inspects a telephone. &ldquo;His last call was at 11:15,&rdquo; she whispers.</p>

				<p>The tour guide opens French doors onto the veranda where New York&rsquo;s mayors have entertained dignitaries from around the world. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very gracious way of living,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Very elegant.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>What impresses Dasani most are not the architectural details or the gold-bound volumes of Chaucer and Tolstoy, but the astonishing lack of dust. She runs her hand lightly over the top of a Steinway piano.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This house is clean.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani was still an infant when Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002. Declaring Gracie Mansion &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he gathered $7 million in private donations &mdash; much of it his own money &mdash; to rehabilitate the pale yellow 18th-century home, which overlooks the East River. In came new plumbing, floors, lighting and ventilation, along with exquisite touches like an 1820s chandelier and a four-poster mahogany bed.</p>

				<p>Facing that same river, six miles away on the opposite side, is the Auburn Family Residence, the squalid city-run homeless shelter where Dasani has lived for more than two years. </p>
			</div>

            <!-- AUBURN ROOM SEQUENCE-->
            <div class="section image_sequence" id="part_2_slideshow_1">
                <div id="part_2_sequence_fixie_slideshow_1" class="sequence_slide_container"></div>
            </div>

			<div class="section column">
				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>She shares a crowded, mouse-infested room with her parents and seven siblings, who sleep doubled up on torn mattresses. </p>

				<p>Dasani spends her days in the care of another city institution: her public school in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.</p>
				</span>

				<p>The Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts has suffered its own troubles under the Bloomberg administration: a shrinking budget and fewer teachers.</p>

				<p>Dasani shuttles between Auburn and McKinney, just two blocks apart. They form the core of her life and the bedrock of her future, one that is in peril.</p>

				<p>Adults who are homeless often speak of feeling &ldquo;stuck.&rdquo; For children, the experience is more like a free-fall. With each passing month, they slip further back in every category known to predict long-term well-being. They are less likely to graduate from the schools that anchor them, and more likely to end up like their parents, their lives circumscribed by teenage pregnancy or shortened by crime and illness.</p>

				<p>In the absence of a steady home or a reliable parent, public institutions have an outsize influence on the destiny of children like Dasani. Whether she can transcend her circumstances rests greatly on the role, however big or small, that society opts to play in her life.</p>

				<p>The question of public responsibility has gained urgency in recent decades. By the time Mr. Bloomberg was elected, children made up 40 percent of shelter residents.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not walking away from taking care of the homeless,&rdquo; the mayor said early on. &ldquo;I have a responsibility, the city has a responsibility, to make sure that the facilities we provide are up to some standards.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The Bloomberg administration set out to revamp the shelter system, creating 7,500 units of temporary housing, a database to track the shelter population and a program intended to prevent homelessness with counseling, job training and short-term financial aid. The new system also made it harder for families to be found eligible for shelter.</p>

				<p>For a time, the numbers went down. But in the wake of profound policy changes and a spiraling economy, more children wound up in shelters than at any time since the creation of the shelter system in the early 1980s.</p>

				<p>While the Bloomberg administration spent $5 billion on shelter services, the conditions at Auburn remained grim. Dasani and her siblings have grown numb to life at the shelter, where knife fights break out and crack pipes are left on the bathroom floor. In the words of their mother, they have &ldquo;become the place.&rdquo; She has a verb for it: shelternized.</p>

				<p>For Dasani, school is everything &mdash; the provider of meals, on-the-spot nursing care, security and substitute parenting. On the Gracie trip, Dasani wears the Nautica coat donated by a school security guard and matching white gloves bestowed to her that morning by the principal.</p>

				<p> A school like McKinney can also provide a bridge to the wider world.</p>

				<p>It does not matter that Dasani&rsquo;s entire sixth grade must walk a mile to the subway in icy winds, take two trains, then walk another 10 minutes before arriving. This round-trip journey, which occupies much of the day, is a welcome escape.</p>

				<p>As Dasani leaves Gracie that afternoon, she refastens her neon-pink snow hat. She has given up on the mayor.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;He lives somewhere else,&rdquo; she says, waving an arm along East End Avenue before heading back to the subway. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">T</span>here is no sign announcing the shelter at 39 Auburn Place, which rises over the neighboring Walt Whitman Houses like an accidental fortress. Its stately, neo-Georgian exterior hints at the shelter&rsquo;s former life as a city hospital.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_2_single_2"></div>

				<p>Two sweeping sycamores shade the entrance, where smokers linger under brick arches, flicking cigarette ashes onto an empty, untended lawn. A concrete walkway leads to the heavily guarded front door, where residents pass through a metal detector and their bags are searched for forbidden objects like canned food, hair dryers and irons.</p>

				<p>Visitors are restricted to the bleak lobby. Upstairs, cries and laughter echo along the dim corridors that Dasani&rsquo;s legally blind sister, Nijai, has learned to feel her way around. The shelter is ill equipped to handle the needs of its numerous disabled residents, among them premature infants and severely autistic children.</p>

				<p>Yet the manual given to incoming families boasts a &ldquo;full complement of professional and support personnel&rdquo; who are &ldquo;available to assist you 24 hours a day, seven days per week.&rdquo; The booklet guarantees residents &ldquo;protection from harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;the right to live in a secure, safe facility.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>A starkly different Auburn &mdash; the one to which Dasani is witness &mdash; emerges from <a href="#" class="nytmm_link_media nytmm_link_doc doc_complaint_robbery"><span class="document_icon"></span>stacks of handwritten complaints</a>, calls to 911, internal staff reports and dozens of inspections over the last decade. It is less a haven than a purgatory.</p>

				<p>There is the 12-year-old boy who writes, on Oct. 29, 2012, that a female resident touched &ldquo;my private area and I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; His mother also files a complaint, saying the woman was showing pornography to children.</p>

				<p> The police are never notified.</p>

				<p>Nor do they hear about a 15-year-old girl who says she was sexually assaulted by a security guard one year earlier. The complaint, written by her mother in Spanish, never appears to have been translated. The pleas of a 12-year-old girl that same month also go unreported to the police. She writes of a man who exposes his genitals in a girls&rsquo; bathroom, making her too afraid to go back without a parent: &ldquo;I am still scared that someone will come in.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>It stands to reason that the complaints of children would be ignored, given how often the warnings of inspectors go nowhere.</p>

				<p>Over the last decade, city and state inspectors have cited Auburn for more than 400 violations &mdash; many of them repeated &mdash; including for inadequate child care, faulty fire protection, insufficient heat, spoiled food, broken elevators, nonfunctioning bathrooms and the presence of mice, roaches, mold, bedbugs, lead and asbestos.</p>

				<p>Dasani can pick out the inspectors by their clipboards and focused expressions. They work for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which supervises homeless housing around the state. Given that Auburn is partly funded by the state, these inspectors should presumably hold sway.</p>

				<p>Year after year, their reports read like a series of unheeded alarms. Responses by the city&rsquo;s Department of Homeless Services attribute Auburn&rsquo;s violations to a lack of money. To the state&rsquo;s complaint, in 2003, that only one staff member is tending to 177 school-age children in the shelter&rsquo;s recreation room, the agency responds: &ldquo;We lack resources for teenagers!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Auburn&rsquo;s children have yet to assume their parents&rsquo; air of defeat. The children&rsquo;s complaints recount their fear or discomfort as reason enough for action. The adults write as if no one is listening.</p>

				<p>Many sound like the parent in April 2012 who has spotted a dead mouse in the cafeteria and asks a janitor to remove it.</p>

				<p>The next day, the mouse is still there. &ldquo;A child could have touched it,&rdquo; the parent recounts telling the janitor, to which the janitor laughs and responds, &ldquo;Well then you should have cleaned it up.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>There is no place on the inspection forms for the most common complaint: the disrespect accorded to residents by the shelter staff. Were there such a box to check, it could never capture how these encounters reverberate for days, reinforcing the rock-bottom failure that Auburn represents.</p>

				<p>Even egregious incidents are sometimes mentioned in passing. One mother summarizes her grievance, at the top of the form, as &ldquo;All of my belongs went in garbbage.&rdquo; In explaining how her possessions were discarded, she mentions, tangentially, that her caseworker had &ldquo;groped&rdquo; her. She ends the complaint on a conciliatory note: &ldquo;Peace.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The signature at the bottom belongs to Dasani&rsquo;s mother, Chanel. After she filed the complaint in September 2011, the worker was taken off her case, but kept his job and recently got a raise. Chanel never told Dasani, for fear of passing on the shame she feels whenever she sees the man.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_2_single_3"></div>

				<p>Like most children, Dasani absorbs more than her mother would like. She can see how the shelter shrinks Chanel&rsquo;s self-regard. Dasani is there when the guards rip through her mother&rsquo;s carefully folded laundry in the name of &ldquo;inspection,&rdquo; or when a caseworker dresses her down like a cheeky adolescent. &ldquo;Sometimes it feels like, &lsquo;Why you guys messin&rsquo; with my mom?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel is not the first woman to encounter sexual advances by an Auburn employee. Another resident complains that a security guard is &ldquo;having sex with clients in the restrooms and in his black Dodge Charger.&rdquo; A 2012 letter by state inspectors to the Department of Homeless Services mentions a security supervisor and guards having &ldquo;improper sexual contact&rdquo; with a resident.</p>

				<p>This environment is especially punishing considering that some of Auburn&rsquo;s women have fled violent men. After a caseworker touched his 46-year-old client on the breast in February 2012, another male employee smiled at her the next day and asked &ldquo;if I was being good,&rdquo; she wrote in a complaint, adding, &ldquo;I walk around every day feeling violated.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Auburn initially suspended the caseworker, Kenneth Durieux, for 30 days. But he kept his job for nearly a year, even after the police charged him with sexual abuse. He was dismissed last January, before pleading guilty to forcible touching.</p>

				<p>Just this year, there have been some 350 calls to 911 from the shelter &mdash; including 24 reported assaults, four calls about possible child abuse and one reporting a rape.</p>

				<p> City officials declined to comment on the reports of sexual abuse. They attribute other lapses to the building&rsquo;s aging infrastructure, saying plans are in the works for an upgraded fire safety system, bathrooms and enhanced security. Since Mr. Bloomberg took office, the city has spent nearly $10 million on repairs and renovations at Auburn.</p>

				<p> In the past decade, Auburn&rsquo;s directors have fared well, receiving raises even as the shelter&rsquo;s problems persisted. One former director, Susan Nayowith, was promoted to head of client advocacy at the Department of Homeless Services.</p>

				<p>These kinds of facts are lost on the shelter&rsquo;s children, who see only what is before them &mdash; like the Swedish meatballs that come frozen in prepackaged trays or the Cheerios served one night for dinner.</p>

				<p>And then there are the elevators, which frequently break down. Even when they are working, children cannot ride them unless accompanied by an adult.</p>

				<p>A month before the trip to Gracie Mansion, when Dasani&rsquo;s sister Avianna walks into the shelter gasping from an asthma attack, a guard refuses to take her up in the elevator. Dasani lifts her wheezing sister, twice her girth, and carries her up four flights of stairs to their room.</p>

				<p>Six months later, it will be Dasani who falls gravely ill when the elevators are broken. She rocks and vomits bile one evening, trying to distract herself by watching television. At 3:02 a.m., Chanel calls 911.</p>

				<p>She helps Dasani down four sets of stairs before she collapses on a row of chairs in the lobby. There is no ambulance, so Chanel calls again. One of the guards gets nervous, making a third call to report that the child &ldquo;is in severe abdominal pain.&rdquo; Two more calls are placed. </p>

				<p>At 4:02 a.m., a full hour later,  an ambulance finally arrives to take Dasani to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where her doctor asks what she last ate. Her answer: a shelter dinner of spinach lasagna.</p>

				<p>In the years that Dasani has lived in Room 449, city and state inspectors have cited at least 13 violations there, including the presence of roaches, mice and a lead paint hazard.</p>

				<p>Yet when Auburn&rsquo;s staff members conduct their own inspections of 449, they focus on the family&rsquo;s transgressions. The room is found to be chaotic and insufficiently clean. There are few mentions of Auburn&rsquo;s own lapses &mdash; the absence of dividers for privacy or assistance with permanent housing. Instead, inspectors focus on the family&rsquo;s forbidden turtle or hidden microwave.</p>

				<p>Dasani finds this curious: &ldquo;They not talking about putting us in a house; they looking for a microwave that don&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Lately, it is the family&rsquo;s sink, with its rotting wall and leaky pipe, that fails to get fixed. For weeks, the pipe drips through the night. Finally, Dasani is fed up. She crouches down and examines the pipe as her siblings watch. &ldquo;Nobody thought about pushing it in and twisting it,&rdquo; she says in her cocksure manner. A few quick jerks and she triumphs. The children squeal.</p>

				<p>It goes unremarked that here, in this shelter with a $9 million annual budget, operated by an agency with more than 100 times those funds, the plumbing has fallen to an 11-year-old girl.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani&rsquo;s homeroom at McKinney is a cozy haven of book-lined shelves and inspirational words scrawled in chalk, like &ldquo;Success does not come without sacrifice and struggle.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Every morning, she quietly tucks her coat and backpack in the classroom closet, a precious ritual for a girl who has no other closet. She then slips into her small wooden desk, opposite her humanities teacher, Faith Hester.</p>

				<p>Miss Hester can best be described as electric. She paces the room, throwing her arms in the air as her booming voice travels along McKinney&rsquo;s hallways. Long after she gave up dreams of acting, her class is the stage and her students, a rapt audience. </p>

				<p>Sometimes she arrives in an Audrey Hepburn updo; other days, she dons the brightly patterned prints procured in Senegal on a trip to &ldquo;learn the truth about my motherland.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She favors expressions like &ldquo;Oh my gooney goo hoo!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Okie pokie dokie shmokie!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>If a student is stumped, she will break into improvised song, with the class soon chanting along: &ldquo;I know you know it!&rdquo; &mdash; clap, clap &mdash; &ldquo;I know you know it!&rdquo; &mdash; clap, clap.</p>
				</span>

				<p>Miss Hester knows that students learn when they get excited. It bothers her that McKinney lacks the sophisticated equipment of other public schools. She shelled out more than $1,000 of her own money, as a single mother, to give her classroom a projector and document camera.</p>

				<p>When Miss Hester looks around her classroom, she sees a glimpse of her younger self. She was raised by a single mother in the Marcy projects of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a monotonous spread of 27 brick buildings with the singular distinction of being where Jay-Z grew up. She could never quite numb herself, like other children did, to the addicts shooting up in the elevator or the dead bodies on gurneys. Her salvation came at church and school.</p>

				<p>In 1979, Miss Hester was one of the first black students to be bused from Marcy to the predominantly white Edward R. Murrow High School in Midwood, Brooklyn. Outside, children would chase after her, yelling, &ldquo;Go back to your neighborhood!&rdquo; Inside the school, she applied herself fastidiously. A teacher made all the difference, guiding her to college applications. She was only 16 when she graduated, bound for SUNY Cortland.</p>

				<p>Thirty-three years and two master&rsquo;s degrees later, it is Miss Hester who searches for the student in need of saving.</p>

				<p>She sees promise in Dasani, who landed on the honor roll last fall. But lately, she is skipping homework and arriving moody and tired, if she makes it to school at all.</p>

				<p>New York&rsquo;s homeless children have an abysmal average attendance rate of 82 percent, well below what is typically needed to advance to the next grade. Since the start of the school year, Dasani has already missed a week of class and arrived late 13 times.</p>

				<p>Her attendance is being closely tracked by a social worker in the school whose nonprofit organization, Partnership With Children, offers counseling and other services to some of the city&rsquo;s most vulnerable students.</p>

				<p> Miss Hester told Partnership about Dasani. She saw no point in turning to the school&rsquo;s guidance counselor or psychologist, who serves two other schools. They jump from crisis to crisis, like E.R. doctors in triage, treating problems that have become acute or irreversible.</p>

				<p>Prevention is a luxury reserved for schools with enough counselors. In their absence, McKinney turns to Partnership, which has weathered its own post-recession budget cuts and layoffs. Graduate students are filling in as interns.</p>

				<p>This is how Dasani finds herself sitting across from Roxanne, who is pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in social work at Fordham University. She has been assigned to lead one-on-one counseling sessions with Dasani.</p>

				<p>Dasani has never had a counselor. They meet once a week, passing the time playing Mancala as Roxanne tries to draw Dasani out, which proves far more difficult than any board game. Dasani knows how to deflect questions with humor, avoiding talk about her family and the shelter.</p>

				<p>She is also studying Roxanne. There is something soft about this Minnesota native, who uses words like &ldquo;sweetie&rdquo; and melts into giggles. Dasani is puzzled by Roxanne&rsquo;s attire &mdash; the rumpled shirts and distressed boots that pass for hip in other Brooklyn quarters. Nothing she wears seems to match, and yet her clothes are spotless.</p>

				<p>This leads Dasani to conclude that Roxanne lives in a clean, suburban home like the kind shown on &ldquo;Criminal Minds,&rdquo; where detectives search for murder clues. It is not the murders themselves that intrigue Dasani so much as the enormous, orderly closets of the crime scenes &mdash; closets big enough to live in.</p>

				<p>Miss Hester wonders about these counseling sessions. She finds Roxanne bright and devoted, but worries that Dasani will run circles around the intern, whose overriding quality is sweetness.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need &lsquo;sweet,&rsquo;&rdquo; Miss Hester says. &ldquo;I need a Ph.D.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">B</span>ack at the shelter, Dasani spends countless hours with her siblings playing games on a Nintendo Wii.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;If Dasani could design her own video game, she would call it &ldquo;Live or Die.&rdquo; The protagonist would be an 11-year-old girl fighting for her own salvation.</p>

				<p>In the first round, she confronts the easy villains &mdash; her chores &mdash; scrambling to bathe, dress and feed her siblings. She cannot find Baby Lele, who is crying. The baby&rsquo;s tears turn into lethal rocks that fall from the sky, which the girl must dodge.</p>

				<p>Next, she encounters her parents battling social workers in the guise of angry pirates. Chanel tosses magical powers to the girl, who defeats the pirates, melting them to the ground.</p>

				<p>In the third round, she goes to school, finding danger and deliverance. Her math teacher is a supervillain whose weapon is numbers. &ldquo;Ten&rdquo; turns into 10 charging porcupines. Down the hall, the girl must rescue Miss Hester from giant, rolling cans. &ldquo;If she dies, all the kids die, too.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Finally, the girl faces off against her longtime rival from the projects, a purple hulk who picks up cars and hurls them. If the girl survives, she reaches the queen &mdash; the principal, Paula Holmes &mdash; who decides her future. Winning brings the prize of a new house. Losing means returning to the shelter, &ldquo;which is death.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;My goal is to make it to the end, but I keep dying,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>It is easier for Dasani to think of Auburn as the worst possible outcome because the alternative &mdash; winding up on the street &mdash; is unfathomable. She knows that if she and her siblings were to lose the shelter, they might land in foster care, losing one another.</p>

				<p>So as bad as it is, the children try to make the place their own. When the lights are on, their room is flatly fluorescent, which prompts them to climb a dresser, remove the plastic lamp cover from the ceiling and color it in with crayons the shades of a rainbow.</p>

				<p>When the lights are off, the room assumes a gray aura not unlike, Dasani imagines, the hospital ward it once was. &ldquo;This was where they put the crazies,&rdquo; she declares, citing as proof a rusted intercom by the door.</p>

				<p>The communal bathroom closest to Dasani is, indeed, reminiscent of &ldquo;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest.&rdquo; Tiled in steely green, its centerpiece is an old, industrial bathtub with no partition. A limp plastic curtain divides the sole shower from the rest of the bathroom, which is marked by vulgar graffiti and shared by dozens of women and girls, though men sometimes intrude. </p>

				<p>The floor is filthy. The children routinely wipe it down with bleach stolen from the janitors, as residents are forbidden to bring the cleaning solvent into Auburn. A changing table hangs off its hinge, pointing to the floor like a slide. </p>
				</span>

				<p>At night, the children hear noises. They are sure Auburn is haunted. Five-year-old Papa calls the ghost in their room &ldquo;I-it.&rdquo; When it is dark, they are far too afraid to use the bathroom, so they relieve themselves in a bucket.</p>

				<p>Yet that bathroom has become Dasani&rsquo;s makeshift sanctuary. She practices hip-hop routines across the floor. She sits alone in the toilet stall, the lid closed beneath her. Sometimes she reads, or just closes her eyes. Her mind feels crowded anywhere else.</p>

				<p>Lately, she is worried about her mother, who has been summoned on Feb. 13 to an urgent meeting at the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services, the agency tasked with protecting the children.</p>

				<p>Photographs of smiling children line the walls of the agency&rsquo;s lobby in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Chanel is greeted by her caseworker, who uses the nickname &ldquo;Mr. James.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not having this meeting because we want to take your kids away,&rdquo; he says cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having this meeting because we want you to move to an apartment.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel stares at him.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ever tell my lawyer about these meetings?&rdquo; she asks, even though she cannot recall the name of the last public defender to represent her.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a lawyer to attend an A.C.S. meeting,&rdquo; he responds.</p>

				<p>They ride the elevator up to a conference room, where Chanel is jarred to find the director of Auburn, Derrick Aiken, waiting. He is there to issue a warning: If Chanel and her husband, Supreme, do not comply with the Department of Homeless Services&rsquo; requirements, the family may be forced to leave the shelter system. At issue is their public assistance case, which has closed because Supreme failed to report to a job placement program, one of dozens of such lapses in the past decade. Currently, the family receives only food stamps and survivor benefits.</p>

				<p>An open public assistance case allows the agency to be reimbursed with federal funds, while also making the family eligible for child care and job training &mdash; the kind of supports that could help in finding a home.</p>

				<p>But the problem for Chanel and Supreme comes down to basic math: Even with two full-time jobs, on minimum wage, they would have combined salaries of only $2,300 per month &mdash; just enough to cover the average rent for a studio in Brooklyn.</p>

				<p>New York, it often strikes Chanel, has no place for the poor.</p>

				<p> Auburn offers plenty of proof. Residents like Jenedra, a home health aide, and her daughter, who works at a Pinkberry in Park Slope, Brooklyn, cannot afford city prices.</p>

				<p>The gap between income and housing costs was widening when Mayor Bloomberg took office in 2002. The homeless population was also growing. For decades, the city had tried to stem the numbers by giving homeless families priority access to public housing, Section 8 vouchers and subsidized city apartments. While the policy was in place, only 11.5 percent of the families returned to shelters within five years.</p>

				<p>To Mr. Bloomberg, priority referrals were an incentive to enter the shelter system. &ldquo;Our own policies needlessly encourage entry and prolong dependence on shelters,&rdquo; he said in 2004.</p>

				<div id="graphic_chart"></div>

				<p>Mr. Bloomberg&rsquo;s approach to homelessness mirrored his views on poverty at large. The mayor&rsquo;s best-known effort was the Center for Economic Opportunity, which spent $662 million on poverty prevention programs that emphasized education and job training as a means to self-reliance.</p>

				<p> In line with that agenda, the mayor ended the priority-referrals policy in November 2004. Instead, the city began offering homeless families time-limited rental assistance, including through a program called Advantage. Yet more than a quarter of them wound up back in shelters once their subsidies ran out.</p>

				<p>Among them was Dasani&rsquo;s family. After their $1,481 rent subsidy expired in 2010, they returned to a shelter system that spends roughly $3,000 per month on every family. It would end up costing the city $400,000 to house Dasani&rsquo;s family over a decade.</p>

				<p>In 2011, Mr. Bloomberg ended Advantage after the state withdrew its funding. Six months later, the city&rsquo;s homeless population hit a record that included more than 16,000 children, many of whom had been homeless before.</p>

				<p>These children have come to be known, among the city&rsquo;s homeless advocates, as &ldquo;the lost generation.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani is well versed in city politics, but not because she follows the news. She is simply forced to notice what other children miss.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;When Mr. Bloomberg tried to ban the sale of large, sugary drinks, Dasani began calculating what two sodas would cost in place of the supersize cup that, in her family, is typically passed among eight small mouths.</p>

				<p>Now it is the citywide bus strike that has called Dasani&rsquo;s attention, by virtue of the fact that she must walk three of her younger siblings to school.</p>

				<p>It is no small feat to corral Papa, Hada and Maya, who form a tempestuous gaggle of untied shoelaces, short tempers and yogurt-stained mouths. </p>

				<p>Dasani shepherds them five long blocks to Public School 287, stepping around used condoms and empty beer cans. &ldquo;Double up!&rdquo; she yells in the manner of her mother. </p>

				<p>The children go silent and reach for each other&rsquo;s hands, waiting for the traffic to pause. Suddenly, they dash like spirits across the six-lane street that runs under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. </p>

				<p>The strike has worn on for a month when, on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Dasani stops into a corner store outside McKinney. </p>
				</span>

				<p>She scans the aisles before settling on an iced honey bun, a bag of nacho-flavored sunflower seeds and some red gummy bears &mdash; a rare $3 breakfast earned as part of her allowance for watching Baby Lele all weekend.</p>

				<p>She glides into class only a few minutes late.</p>

				<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson is about context clues, in preparation for standardized tests that are coming. &ldquo;You come across an unfamiliar word,&rdquo; Miss Hester explains. &ldquo;You look at the surrounding words and ideas and you unpack that word.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The theatrics begin.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;Flabbergasted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was flabbergasted when I found a million dollars in my purse.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The class erupts in laughter.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;A million dollars!&rdquo; Miss Hester hoots. &ldquo;I know that that&rsquo;s a lot of money. And it&rsquo;s in my purse. And I&rsquo;m supposed to be broke,&rdquo; she says, batting her long lashes. &ldquo;&lsquo;Flabbergasted&rsquo; means &lsquo;delightfully surprised.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani is delightfully surprised whenever she is in Miss Hester&rsquo;s presence. It does not matter that her mother finds the teacher &ldquo;weird.&rdquo; She makes Dasani want to learn.</p>

				<p>One can only imagine the heights Dasani might reach at a school like Packer Collegiate Institute, just 12 blocks west of the shelter. Its campus has a theater with computerized lighting, &ldquo;green&rdquo; science labs and a menu offering chipotle lime tilapia and roasted herb chicken. Its middle school cultivates the interests of the &ldquo;whole child,&rdquo; for whom doors will open to the &ldquo;public arenas of the world.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Packer&rsquo;s students might learn something from Dasani, too. Parents from five private Brooklyn schools recently filed into Packer, where tuition is over $35,000, to hear a clinical psychologist give a talk on how to raise &ldquo;self-reliant, appreciative children in a nervous and entitled world.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>That world is unlikely to become Dasani&rsquo;s. She is not the kind of child to land a coveted scholarship to private school, which would require a parent with the wherewithal to seek out such opportunities and see them through. For the same reason, Dasani does not belong to New York&rsquo;s fast-growing population of charter school students.</p>

				<p>In fact, the reverse is happening: a charter school is coming to McKinney. Approved last December by the Education Department, Success Academy Fort Greene will soon claim half of McKinney&rsquo;s third floor. This kind of co-location arrangement has played out in schools across the city, stoking deep resentments in poor communities.</p>

				<p>The guiding ethos of the charter school movement has been &ldquo;choice&rdquo; &mdash; the power to choose a school rather than capitulate to a flawed education system and a muscular teachers&rsquo; union. But in communities like McKinney&rsquo;s, the experience can feel like a lack of choice.</p>

				<p>Dasani watched, wide-eyed, during a protest last December as McKinney&rsquo;s parents and teachers held up signs comparing the co-location to apartheid. Charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated, serve fewer students with special needs, and are sometimes perceived as exclusive.</p>

				<p>A web posting for Success Academy Fort Greene does little to counter that notion. Parents, it says, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t have to trek to other Brooklyn neighborhoods or spend $30,000+ on a private school in order to find excellence and rigor.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>By late February, Dasani&rsquo;s grades have plummeted. On her wrist is a bite mark left by a classmate whom she had fought after the girl called her &ldquo;musty.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The next day, Dasani lunges at a girl in gym class. Miss Hester has had enough.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not happy with the way that you are victimizing others,&rdquo; she says sternly. &ldquo;I need it to stop immediately. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She nods at Miss Hester, her eyes dropping.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_2_single_4"></div>

				<p>For Dasani, school and life are indistinguishable. When school goes well, she is whole. When it goes poorly, she can&rsquo;t compartmentalize like some students, who simply &ldquo;focus&rdquo; on their studies.</p>

				<p>It is a place to love or leave.</p>

				<p>Minutes later, Dasani is sitting in McKinney&rsquo;s packed auditorium for an assembly on Black History Month.</p>

				<p>She hates Black History Month.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the same poems,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>The new honor roll is called out. Dasani&rsquo;s name is missing. It must be a mistake, she tells herself. But when she hears all the other names, the truth sinks in.</p>

				<p>She slumps in her chair as a group of boys takes the stage to recite Langston Hughes.</p>

				<p class="lines">What happens to a dream deferred?</p>
				<p class="lines">Does it dry up </p>
				<p class="lines nobotmarg">like a raisin in the sun?</p>

				<p>Dasani knows this poem well. They read it every year. She stares blankly at the stage.</p>

				<p class="lines">Maybe it just sags</p>
				<p class="lines">Like a heavy load</p>
				<p class="lines">Or does it explode?</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph top"><span class="pov_first_letter">O</span>n the Brooklyn block that is Dasani&rsquo;s dominion, shoppers can buy a $3 malt liquor in an airless deli where food stamps are traded for cigarettes. Or they can cross the street for a $740 bottle of chardonnay at an industrial wine shop accented with modern art. </p>

				<p>It is a sign outside that locale, Gnarly Vines, that catches Dasani&rsquo;s notice one spring afternoon: &ldquo;Wine Tasting Tonight 5-8.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani is hardly conversant in the subject of libations, but this much she knows: A little drink will take off her mother&rsquo;s edge. Without further ado, Chanel heads into the wine shop on Myrtle Avenue, trailed by four of her eight children. They are lugging two greasy boxes of pizza and a jumbo pack of diapers from Target.</p>

				<p>The cashier pauses. The sommelier smiles.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Wanna try a little ros&eacute;?&rdquo; she asks brightly, pouring from a 2012 bottle of Mas de Gourgonnier. &ldquo;I would describe it as definitely fruit forward at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel polishes it.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;But really crisp, dry, refreshing &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Not refreshing,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;I just think dry.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s very dry,&rdquo; says the sommelier, a peppy blonde in wire-rim glasses. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s high acid, a little citrusy.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel sticks out her tongue. She finds the woman&rsquo;s choice of words unappetizing. To the side of the wine display is a large, silver vase that recalls the family urn, prompting Chanel&rsquo;s son Khaliq to ask if it contains the ashes of a dead person.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh, for cremation?&rdquo; the sommelier asks, shaking her head. &ldquo;We just use it for spitting in.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;For spitting?&rdquo; Chanel says with horror.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s got rejected wine in it,&rdquo; the sommelier says.</p>

				<p>Chanel scoffs. She might not like the wine, but she sees no reason to spit it out. She moves on to a Tuscan sangiovese.</p>

				<p>Ignoring the spectacle, Dasani scans the room, frowning at a sign on the wall: Liqueur. &ldquo;They got liquor spelled wrong,&rdquo; she yelps victoriously.</p>

				<p>Actually, the sommelier interjects, that is the French word for the delicate, liquid spirits derived from fruits such as pomegranates and raspberries. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re very right,&rdquo; she offers sweetly. &ldquo;That is not how you spell liquor.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Not the hood liquor,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani&rsquo;s neighborhood is one of the most unequal pockets of New York City, the most unequal metropolis in America.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Fort Greene occupies less than one square mile. On the map, its boundaries form the shape of a pitcher tilting at the northwestern edge of Brooklyn.</p>

				<p>Just north of Fort Greene Park are the projects and, among them, the homeless shelter where Dasani lives.</p>

				<p>Just south of the park are some of Brooklyn&rsquo;s finest townhouses and cultural gems, including the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where theatergoers were lining up to see &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; on the day that Dasani led her mother to the wine shop.</p>

				<p>If one thing distinguishes Dasani&rsquo;s New York from that of her antecedents, it is a striking proximity to the wealth that eludes her.</p>

				<p>She routinely walks past a boho-chic boutique on Lafayette Avenue where calfskin boots command $845. Heading north, she passes French bulldogs on leashes and infants riding like elevated genies in Uppababy strollers with shock-absorbing wheels. Three blocks away is an ice cream parlor where $6 buys two salted-caramel scoops.</p>

				<p>Like most children, Dasani is oblivious to the precise cost of such extravagances. She only knows that they are beyond her reach.</p>

				<p>Nor can this 11-year-old girl be expected to grasp the subtle gradations of Fort Greene&rsquo;s elite, whose creative class feels pushed out of a neighborhood it once considered more gritty than tony.</p>

				<p>Dasani sees the chasms of Fort Greene more plainly, reasoning that wealth belongs to &ldquo;the whites&rdquo; because &ldquo;they save their money and don&rsquo;t spend it on drinking and smoking.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Such perceptions are fed by the contrasts of this neighborhood, where the top 5 percent of residents earn 76 times as much as the bottom quintile. Dasani spots addicts gathering outside a food pantry a block from $2 million brownstones. She notes that few people in the projects use the Citi Bikes stationed nearby. The celebrated bike sharing program, unveiled this year, requires a credit or debit card for a $101 security deposit.</p>

				<p>Dasani also knows that not everyone in the projects is poor. Her Uncle Waverly, who lives in the Walt Whitman Houses across from her shelter, the Auburn Family Residence, works as a supervisor for the parks department and has a Lexus S.U.V. When he drives past Dasani and her siblings, he pretends not to know them.</p>

				<p>Dasani charts the patterns of Fort Greene Park by skin color. The basketball courts are closest to the projects, drawing black children to that northwestern corner. On the rare occasion when Dasani ventures to the opposite quadrant, she sees white women sunbathing in bikinis or playing tennis near a water fountain outfitted for dogs.</p>

				<p>She never finds those women at the nearby Bravo Supermarket for Values, where thieves are photographed in Polaroids that fill the store&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wall of Shame.&rdquo; Wearing naked expressions, they are forced to pose with their stolen items &mdash; things like Goya beans and Kraft cheese. A woman named Mary holds a can of tuna in a photograph titled &ldquo;Catch of the Day.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani is more likely to encounter shoppers of another stratum at the local Target, where they can save on items that for her family represent a splurge.</p>

				<p>Fort Greene&rsquo;s two economies are an experiment born of meteoric gentrification. In the last decade, the neighborhood has been remade, with the portion of white residents jumping by 80 percent as real estate prices more than doubled despite the recession.</p>

				<p>Just the word &ldquo;gentrification&rdquo; is remarkably divisive.  It derives from the Middle English word &ldquo;gentrise,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;of noble descent.&rdquo; The word has become shorthand for an urban neighborhood where muggings are down and espresso is roasted &mdash; a place that has been &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; as though no one had been living there.</p>

				<p>Dasani&rsquo;s Fort Greene reaches deep into the last century. Her grandmother Joanie grew up in the Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses, next to the Walt Whitman Houses. Both projects opened in 1944, an era of New Deal reforms that gave rise to white flight and urban decay. Fort Greene, like other black areas, was redlined, allowing banks to disinvest and property values to plummet.</p>

				<p>The neighborhood&rsquo;s prospects started to change in 1978, after the city declared part of Fort Greene a historic district. By the time Dasani was born there in 2001, a billionaire was preparing to run for mayor. A year after taking office, Michael R. Bloomberg announced an ambitious redevelopment plan for Downtown Brooklyn.</p>

				<p>Fort Greene&rsquo;s transformation came swiftly. Through aggressive rezoning and generous subsidies, the city drew developers who, in the span of three years, built 19 luxury buildings in the surrounding area that catered &mdash; across racial lines &mdash; to the educated elite.</p>

				<p>Dasani and her siblings routinely pass the Toren, a glistening, 38-story glass tower on Myrtle Avenue offering a 24-hour concierge, gymnasium, pool and movie theater. In June, a condominium there sold for $1.4 million.</p>

				<p>Just blocks away stand the Ingersoll and Whitman projects, which engulf Dasani&rsquo;s shelter and, like Auburn, have fallen into disrepair.</p>

				<p>It is the juxtaposition of these neglected time capsules to Fort Greene&rsquo;s luxury towers that seems to mock the neighborhood&rsquo;s effort at ascension. For the arriviste investor, the projects present a rude visual interruption, an inconvenient thing to walk around, but never through.</p>

				<p>For Dasani, these faded buildings hold a legacy so intricate and rich it could fill volumes were it ever told.</p>

				<p>The homeless shelter where she lives is the very building where Grandma Joanie had been born, back when it was Cumberland Hospital. Just across the way is the fifth-story apartment where Joanie grew up, helping her own mother raise seven other children in the clasp of poverty.</p>

				<p>Three generations later, little has changed. Even as the fortunes of this neighborhood rose, Dasani&rsquo;s matrilineal line, from her great-grandmother to her mother, has followed a trajectory of teenage pregnancy, addiction and violence.</p>

				<p>Fort Greene is now a marker. For one set of people, arriving signals triumph. For another, remaining means defeat.</p>

				<p>Dasani will do better, she tells herself. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t go nowhere in Brooklyn,&rdquo; she says. Chanel promises they will move this spring, after the tax refunds arrive.</p>

				<p>Yet as Dasani walks through her grandmother&rsquo;s streets, it is not with the sense of imminent departure so much as melancholic return. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hanel was 8 when she found her mother&rsquo;s crack pipe in a jewelry box. She held it up to the light and showed it to her brother.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;We gonna toss it, he said.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;They opened the window and watched as the brown glass vial soared through the air, crashing onto the sidewalk.</p>

				<p>It was the mid-1980s, and crack had swept the streets of Brownsville, Brooklyn, where Chanel&rsquo;s mother, Joanie, now lived. Chanel visited on weekends. The rest of the time, she stayed with her godmother, Sherry, who had been the common-law wife of Chanel&rsquo;s father. Chanel&rsquo;s mother was his lover.</p>

				<p>Stranger things had happened in Brownsville, and now that Chanel&rsquo;s father was dead, the two women made peace, despite their differences. Joanie relied on welfare to support her habit. Sherry ran a day care center and shunned drugs.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;It was like two different people trying to raise one kid,&rdquo; Chanel says. </p>

            	<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_3_single_1"></div>

				<p>At Sherry&rsquo;s rowhouse in East New York, Brooklyn, Chanel minded her chores and did her homework.</p>

				<p>At Joanie&rsquo;s, the child watched dance parties meld into a predawn haze. </p>

				<p>Worried that Joanie would unduly influence Chanel, Sherry sent the 10-year-old girl to live with a relative in Pittsburgh and attend Catholic school. But Chanel longed for her birth mother and began to act out. Within a few years, she returned to New York and moved in with Joanie. They soon wound up in a shelter in Queens, where both were exposed to tuberculosis.</p>

				<p>Over the next few years, they drifted apart.</p>

				<p>Joanie turned her life around after President Bill Clinton signed legislation in 1996 to end &ldquo;welfare as we know it,&rdquo; placing time limits and work restrictions on recipients of government aid. She got clean and joined a welfare-to-work program, landing a $22,000-a-year job cleaning subway cars for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. &ldquo;This is the happiest day of my life,&rdquo; she told Chanel.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_3_single_2"></div>

				<p>By then, Chanel had dropped out of high school and was addicted to crack. She had joined a sect of the violent Bloods gang, tattooing her street name, Lady Red, in curly letters across her right arm. She was a regular in the crack dens of Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>

				<p>Chanel first noticed white people in &ldquo;the Stuy&rdquo; after a snowstorm swept Brooklyn in the late 1990s. Out of nowhere, two cross-country skiers appeared along Franklin Avenue like &ldquo;a pair of aliens.&rdquo; She watched as the skiers coasted by, carving a trail through virgin snow.</p>

				<p>She sensed that Brooklyn was on the cusp of change. But she could not have imagined that just five blocks from that spot, people would one day line up to buy blood orange and hibiscus doughnuts at an artisanal shop called Dough.</p>

				<p>The first commercial signs of Brooklyn&rsquo;s transition were simpler. In 2001, Chanel spotted a new brand of bottled water &mdash; Dasani &mdash; on the shelves of her corner store. She was pregnant again, but unlike the miscarriages of her teens, this baby was surviving. Chanel needed a name.</p>

				<p>For a 23-year-old Brooklyn native who had spent summers cooling in the gush of hydrants, the name &ldquo;Dasani&rdquo; held a certain appeal. It sounded as special as Chanel&rsquo;s name had sounded to her own mother, when she saw the perfume advertised in a magazine. It grasped at something better.</p>

				<p>Dasani was born on May 26 at Brooklyn Hospital Center in Fort Greene. The doll-faced infant weighed only 5 pounds 6 ounces. She was strikingly alert and had, the nurse noted, a &ldquo;vigorous cry.&rdquo; Three days later, Chanel left her with Joanie and took off.</p>

				<p>Even as a baby, Dasani was awake to the world. She leaned out of her stroller and stared at passers-by, who called her &ldquo;Batman eyes.&rdquo; She was tiny, but never frail, and began walking at only 8 months.</p>

				<p>Chanel would surface from time to time, but Dasani latched on to Joanie. A year later, Chanel had a second daughter by the same man, naming her Avianna, inspired by the more expensive brand of Evian water.</p>

				<p>Joanie had hit her limit, so Chanel turned to the city&rsquo;s shelter system. With both babies, she reported to the Department of Homeless Services intake office in the Bronx. They were sent to 30 Hamilton Place, a family shelter in Harlem.</p>

				<p>Down the hall, a single father had moved in with his own two children. He called himself Supreme. He had sad, knowing eyes that made him look older than his 26 years. He never talked about the past. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">S</span>upreme was born to heroin addicts in the Cypress Hills projects of East New York. By age 7, he knew how to shop with his mother&rsquo;s food stamps and cook grits for his four younger siblings. When the pantry was empty, he made sugar sandwiches. </p>

				<p>He was 9 when he came upon the lifeless body of his baby sister. She had been left near the entrance of the projects, wrapped in a blanket. Supreme stroked her head and kept saying her name, Precious. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t wake up,&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>Investigators for Child Protective Services thought the 2-year-old girl had swallowed sleeping pills, though the medical examiner concluded that she had died of sudden infant death syndrome. The father had left Precious alone when she died. When her mother found her, Supreme recalled, she panicked, leaving the girl&rsquo;s body outside as she ran for help.</p>

				<p>Later that day, the agency&rsquo;s workers removed Supreme and his siblings from the home. For the next three years, Supreme bounced from foster care to group homes. He soon dropped out of school and left for North Carolina to join the crack trade. By 17, Supreme had a felony drug conviction and was serving time at a maximum-security prison in Walpole, Mass.</p>

				<p>It was there that he discovered the Five Percent Nation, a growing movement whose followers believe they are the chosen &ldquo;5 percent&rdquo; of humanity. The Five Percenters were shaping urban culture and music, while spreading the word that the black man is God.</p>

				<p>That message &mdash; that God was within him &mdash; filled Supreme with a sense of power over his destiny, one that until now had been steered by outsiders.</p>

				<p>Supreme left prison in 1997 with a high school equivalency diploma. He married and moved to Washington, finding work as a barber. Six years later, his wife &mdash; pregnant with their third child &mdash; had a heart attack and fell down a flight of stairs to her death.</p>

				<p>Chanel took pity on this solemn widower, who came to the shelter a few months after his wife&rsquo;s passing. Dasani and Avianna were the exact same ages as his children. He seemed different from the other men. He was always reading, and had a way with words.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I fell in love with his brains,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>Two incomplete families soon became one.</p>

				<p> Chanel embraced the Five Percent, wrapping her head in a scarf and vowing to stay off drugs. They married at the city clerk&rsquo;s office on Feb. 4, 2004.</p>

				<p>For Chanel, it was a moment of triumph. Women in her family almost never married.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;We were the product of split-up families,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We always wanted a big family. One family. One full family.&rdquo;</p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>But Supreme and Chanel had a temperamental love. Their biggest fights led to brief separations, even as three more children were born. </p>

				<p>Chanel could not stay off drugs for long. When she gave birth to Papa in 2007, the hospital detected marijuana in his blood. </p>
				</span>

				<p>In an instant, everything changed. </p>

				<p>Chanel and Supreme were summoned to the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services office in Bedford-Stuyvesant &mdash; the same brick building where Supreme had been escorted as a child.</p>

				<p>Standing there, in the lobby, the memory came rushing back. Supreme was 9 again, losing his sister, then his parents, then his other siblings, all in the course of a day.</p>

				<p>Soon his own children became accustomed to knocks at the door as the agency&rsquo;s caseworkers, responding to a handful of complaints about possible neglect, began to monitor the family. They inspected the children from head to toe, searching for signs of abuse.</p>

				<p>Dasani learned to spot a social worker on the street by the person&rsquo;s bag (large enough to hold files). She became expert at the complex psychic task of managing strangers &mdash; of reading facial expressions and interpreting intonations, of knowing when to say the right thing or to avoid the wrong one.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;They can use that in a court of law against the parent,&rdquo; she says, back in the voice of &ldquo;Criminal Minds.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She pauses.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I love my parents. They&rsquo;re tough, but I should not be taken away from them.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani remained tethered to Grandma Joanie, who had proudly kept her job as a sanitation worker. She now lived in a cozy apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant. On weekends, Joanie would fix the children B.L.T. sandwiches and meticulously braid their hair before snuggling up to watch Beyonc&eacute; videos.</p>

				<p>Dasani was Joanie&rsquo;s favorite. With this child, Joanie could finally be a mother. With Joanie, Dasani could be a child.</p>

				<p>A few months shy of Dasani&rsquo;s eighth birthday, Joanie fell gravely ill with leukemia.</p>

				<p>On March 7, 2008, she died in the same hospital where Dasani had been born. She was 55.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Why she had to go away so quickly?&rdquo; Dasani asks.</p>

				<p>At the funeral, mourners gasped as the tiny girl flung herself on the open coffin. Dasani kicked and wailed as Chanel tore her away. </p>

				<p>Joanie was cremated and her ashes placed in a black and silver urn that remained with Dasani&rsquo;s family, accompanying them like a talisman.</p>

				<p>Her death brought a rebirth. Chanel inherited $49,000 of Joanie&rsquo;s pension savings.</p>

				<p>At the time, the family had been renting a small apartment in East New York through a city program offering time-limited subsidies to the homeless.</p>

				<p>That month, the family&rsquo;s subsidy expired.</p>

				<p>Chanel&rsquo;s inheritance saved them from homelessness. Months later, the city began a new rent subsidy program called Advantage. With its help, Chanel leased a duplex on Staten Island, and in summer 2008, boarded the Staten Island Ferry with Supreme and the children. It was their first time on a boat. They raced to the back and leaned into the salty mist.</p>

				<p>Staten Island was quiet and green. In their new apartment on North Burgher Avenue, the children rolled around on the wall-to-wall carpet. There they lay, pressed together, that first night.</p>

				<p>It was their first real home. The children&rsquo;s euphoria steadily rose with that of their parents.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;When they&rsquo;re happy, I&rsquo;m happy,&rdquo; Dasani says. &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re sad, I&rsquo;m sad. It&rsquo;s like I have a connection, like I&rsquo;m stuck to them like glue.&rdquo;</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_3_single_3"></div>

				<p>Chanel and Supreme talked giddily of starting a youth center that would teach the Five Percent ethos known as the &ldquo;Five P&rsquo;s&rdquo;: proper planning prevents poor performance.</p>

				<p>Supreme landed a job at Heavenly Cuts, a barbershop a few blocks away. Chanel bought a used, cherry-red Dodge Durango and a rolling kitchen island at Home Depot. She decorated the girls&rsquo; room with pink Barbie curtains, sheets and matching TVs. The children ran barefoot in the backyard, racing across a Slip &rsquo;N Slide as Supreme grilled burgers. Joanie&rsquo;s urn occupied a place of honor in the living room.</p>

				<p>This was, without question, the high point of their collective life.</p>

				<p>It would take years for Chanel to understand why things so quickly fell apart. It was not obvious, in that blinding moment, that money could be useful only if they knew how to spend it. To think it would bring salvation was as quixotic as expecting a set of keys to drive a car.</p>

				<p>Money was not going to heal a father who had never been a child. When customers took a seat in Supreme&rsquo;s chair at the barbershop, they saw a pair of hands expertly at work. They did not see the boy who, at age 7, had learned that very skill by cutting his brothers&rsquo; hair while his parents were strung out on heroin.</p>

				<p>What money brought was a quick escape from all that. Over the next two years, Supreme and Chanel bobbed and wove through a fog of addiction. Supreme started doing heroin. Chanel became hooked on painkillers during an extended stay at Staten Island Hospital, where she was being treated for a recurrence of the tuberculosis she contracted in a shelter.</p>

				<p>Children&rsquo;s Services hovered over the family, ensuring that Chanel and Supreme submit to random drug tests. Eventually, Supreme and Chanel stopped working.</p>

				<p>By August 2010, bedbugs had infested the family&rsquo;s house, just as their rent subsidy once again expired.</p>

				<p>The city&rsquo;s shelters were filling with former Advantage recipients &mdash; families who had been homeless before taking the rent subsidy, only to become homeless again.</p>

				<p>On Aug. 20, Dasani&rsquo;s family boarded the ferry to Manhattan, where they headed to the Department of Homeless Services&rsquo;s intake office in the South Bronx.</p>

				<p>As Dasani&rsquo;s family approached the entrance, Chanel spotted two abandoned baby turtles in a cardboard box. She stuffed them in her pockets.</p>

				<p>Six days later, the family arrived at Auburn, along with its two forbidden pet turtles and Joanie&rsquo;s urn. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hildren are said to be adaptable. On outward appearances, Dasani and her siblings became inured to the dehumanizing ways of Auburn &mdash; the security checks at the entrance, the grimy bathrooms, the long waits for rancid food. </p>

				<p>Yet nothing prepared them for what happened on Sept. 7, 2011, a year after they arrived.</p>

				<p>Chanel and the children had been &ldquo;logged out&rdquo; of Auburn, the official description of what happens when residents who have been absent for more than 48 hours are sent to the Bronx intake office to fill out forms and answer questions. The entire family must make this onerous trip, even on school days.</p>

				<p>That evening, tired and hungry, they returned to their room. It looked ransacked. Almost everything was gone: their clothes, shoes, books, television, toys, Social Security cards, birth certificates, photographs, love letters &mdash; the traces of their existence.</p>

				<p>Joanie&rsquo;s urn had also vanished.</p>

				<p>Chanel raced down to the security guards, Dasani chasing after her.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Where are my mother&rsquo;s ashes?&rdquo; she screamed. The story soon emerged: An Auburn employee had paid a resident $10 to clean out the room, as other residents looted the family&rsquo;s valuables. Everything else was tossed in the garbage.</p>

				<p>Chanel bolted to the back of the shelter, where a large, metal incinerator holds Auburn&rsquo;s rotting trash. She waded in, the garbage reaching her waist. She searched frantically. This could not be Joanie&rsquo;s final resting place, she kept telling herself.</p>

				<p>She cursed. She wept aloud.</p>

				<p>Finally, she stopped. The truth was setting in. Fifty-seven years after Joanie had been born, here in this very building, her remains were dumped in the garbage.</p>

				<p>Upstairs, the room felt cursed.</p>

				<p>Joanie had always protected the children, in life and in death. Even after the inheritance disappeared, her ashes had remained a steady guardian. But now Joanie was gone. In her absence, a devastating chain of events unfolded.</p>

				<p>Chanel paced the room that evening, desperate and broke. Supreme was gone after another fight. She expected no help from Auburn. Still, she had gone to the <a href="#" class="nytmm_link_media nytmm_link_doc doc_complaint_chanel"><span class="document_icon"></span>trouble of filing a complaint</a>, writing in hurried print, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do my kid start school tomorrow and I have nothing.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The next day, Chanel left the children alone in the room, defying the shelter&rsquo;s rules, and hit the streets in search of cash. A man approached her on Myrtle Avenue asking where he could buy drugs. He did not look like an undercover officer, so she steered him to the projects. She was arrested and later pleaded guilty to drug possession charges, though Chanel maintains she was innocent.</p>

				<p>When Chanel did not return that night, Dasani felt something in the air. There was a knock at the door. Dasani shushed the kids. They pretended to be asleep. Then the door opened as an Auburn supervisor and Homeless Services police told the children to get dressed.</p>

				<p>The Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services had known for months that Chanel was getting high on opiates, but had been trying to keep the family together. After her arrest, a family judge ordered new drug tests for both parents, revealing that Supreme had also been smoking marijuana.</p>

				<p>With that, the agency went to court to have the children removed. In a hearing on Sept. 20, the children&rsquo;s lawyer objected, arguing that to divide them among foster homes &ldquo;who knows where in the city&rdquo; would &ldquo;present a greater imminent risk to the children than remaining where they are.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The judge struck a compromise: Both parents needed to comply with a drug treatment program. The children were to remain with Supreme, but Chanel temporarily lost custody.</p>

				<p>She had suffered all kinds of losses, but nothing compared with this. Who was she if not a mother? She had always tried to be there, rarely missing a school play or a parent-teacher conference. On Sunday afternoons she would braid hair until her fingers turned numb. At bedtime each night, she flipped through the family dictionary to teach her children a new &ldquo;word of the day.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Now, Chanel would be living with Sherry, only seeing the children on supervised visits. She broke the news to the children on a park bench.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;Take care of your siblings,&rdquo; she instructed Dasani.</p>

				<p>Dasani was silent.</p>

				<p>Supreme ruled by fear. If the children laughed too loud, he only had to yell &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; and they froze, a silent dread passing among them. He had an old-fashioned approach to child rearing: Break the rules and you get the belt. Chanel&rsquo;s presence had tempered him.</p>

				<p>When she left, Supreme wrote two words on the wall in black marker: &ldquo;King Me!&rdquo; </p>
				
				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_3_single_4"></div>

				<p>Under the agency&rsquo;s supervision, both Chanel and Supreme made steady progress in a treatment program that required taking daily doses of methadone, a synthetic drug meant to control addiction.</p>

				<p>Nearly a year later, on Aug. 2, 2012, the judge allowed Chanel to return to her family at Auburn under supervision from the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services. She came with a promise: They would save enough money to leave. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hanel spreads the cash across her bed, all $2,800. The children stare in awe.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I feel so happy,&rdquo; Avianna says.</p>

				<p>Chanel quickly stashes it, announcing no intention of spending her long-awaited tax refund, which arrived Feb. 13.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Once you start to break them bills, that&rsquo;s it, they&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; Chanel says the next morning. She is walking through the projects, the money bulging from her pocket. She does not know where to put it, so she holds onto it and, more than anything, the feeling of having it.</p>

				<p>She pushes Baby Lele&rsquo;s creaky stroller toward Downtown Brooklyn, whose street names mockingly suggest riches. Gold. Tillary. Bond. She takes an inventory of all the things she could &mdash; but won&rsquo;t &mdash; buy: a new stroller, sneakers, a hair-braiding session for the girls.</p>

				<p>Chanel knows that unless she finds a way to save her money, and persuades Supreme not to spend his own tax refund, they will never leave Auburn.</p>

				<p>And yet, planning has never been their way. &ldquo;To plan something is to plan to fail,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My plan is to do some goddamn laundry.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Tax season brings a sudden reprieve for a family that, with food stamps, has about $75 a day to spend. This amounts to $7.50 per person in a city where three subway trips cost as much. They survive because they live rent-free and have access to three meals a day.</p>

				<p>Chanel is reminded of this when she stops to look at listings in the window of a real estate office near her methadone clinic. A one-bedroom in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, is going for $1,300 a month.</p>

				<p>She sees no option but to leave New York. In a show of commitment, Chanel gives $800 of her tax refund to Grandma Sherry in exchange for a used Chevrolet minivan, which is sitting in the driveway with no permit.</p>

				<p>Now they must wait for Supreme&rsquo;s tax refund.</p>

				<p>If only life imitated Monopoly, Supreme&rsquo;s favorite board game, which he plays with the children on a mattress in their crowded room. &ldquo;I like building up property and collecting rent,&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>But becoming a real renter, he finds, is far more challenging than claiming Park Place on a cardboard square.</p>

				<p>Auburn no longer has a housing specialist on staff &mdash; the last one died four years ago and was never replaced. Supreme has learned to navigate the web on his prepaid Android from Boost Mobile, but the phone is often disconnected. Chanel feels like a fumbling fool on the shelter&rsquo;s computers.</p>

				<p>And then there is the problem of Baby Lele. Investigators have repeatedly cited Auburn for providing no on-site child care, which hinders residents from searching for jobs or housing. Chanel is reluctant to leave Lele with other mothers at Auburn, many of whom have their own Children&rsquo;s Services cases. If anything were to happen, Chanel&rsquo;s custody could be in jeopardy.</p>

				<p>Instead, Chanel begins leaving Lele under the watch of a friendly counselor at her methadone program, where children are not allowed. The counselor stands outside with Lele as Chanel darts in to swallow her orange liquid dose.</p>

				<p>When a clinic supervisor discovers the arrangement, Chanel is exposed. If she keeps leaving Lele with acquaintances on the street, Children&rsquo;s Services might find out. So Chanel stops going, and the clinic alerts the agency that she has fallen out of treatment. In March, the agency steps up its scrutiny, placing the family with a &ldquo;prevention worker&rdquo; who requires twice-weekly meetings.</p>

				<p>By now, Supreme has learned that his tax refund was seized by the government for child support owed to two other children he had before meeting Chanel.</p>

				<p>Dasani knows before her mother says a word.</p>

				<p>They will not be leaving.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani has learned to let disappointments pass in silence. Objecting does nothing to change the facts.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;But she reveals herself through the questions she asks.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Mommy, if these projects was your only choice, would you take it?&rdquo; she asks Chanel one day in March as they are out walking. Chanel nods reluctantly.</p>

				<p>Dasani lets it go. She knows not to push.</p>

				<p>Spring has brought a new set of worries. For the wealthier children in Fort Greene, it is a season to show off new wardrobes. For Dasani&rsquo;s family, it is a time of scrambling. Appearances are more easily kept when the same coat is all that people see. </p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_3_single_5"></div>

				<p>The project kids begin to ridicule Dasani&rsquo;s pink sweatsuit, calling it &ldquo;pajamas.&rdquo; On March 19, she agrees to fight a girl from school at nearby Commodore Barry Park. A crowd gathers as they establish the rules: No one can film it or tell a parent. They pull back their hair and Dasani punches her rival as they tumble to the ground. A man walking his dog pulls them apart.</p>

				<p>That evening, Chanel inspects the cut on Dasani&rsquo;s lip.</p>

				<p>Chanel may fail in all kinds of ways, but she holds Dasani&rsquo;s esteem in one powerful regard: The woman can fight. Dasani has grown up hearing her mother&rsquo;s stories of street-battle glory, and watching her in the throes of countless slug matches with anyone who crosses her, including the owner of a local laundromat.</p>

				<p>Chanel dismisses Dasani&rsquo;s tussles at school as &ldquo;kitty-cat fighting.&rdquo; Back in her day, girls cracked one another over the head with bottles. No one wasted time pulling back their hair.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You gotta keep your hood credit up,&rdquo; she tells Dasani. &ldquo;You take the biggest, baddest one down first and the rest of &rsquo;em will back up off of you. That&rsquo;s just how it works.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The next day, Chanel and Dasani wander up their favorite block of Myrtle Avenue, passing the Red Lantern, a bike repair shop that sells vegan cookies. They stop at a juice store that serves a hybrid clientele &mdash; Fort Greene&rsquo;s organic-forward newcomers and its health-conscious old-timers.</p>

				<p>There, Chanel spots an old flame. He wears a long leather jacket and dark shades. She wonders if he is still dealing.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Whassup, Red?&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>Dasani eyes him closely.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That was her name from back when she was in the hood,&rdquo; she says, forever cataloging the details of her mother&rsquo;s past, even as Chanel tries to part with it.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good now, see?&rdquo; Chanel crows, waving a hand over herself, as if motioning a transformation: clean, married, mother of eight. She nods proudly at her children.</p>

				<p>It is Dasani&rsquo;s belief that she and her siblings are the cause of her mother&rsquo;s ruin. It never occurs to her that, for Chanel, the children represent her only accomplishment.</p>

				<p>The next day, Chanel escorts Dasani to school. In the hallway, she spots the girl Dasani fought in the park. &ldquo;You can fight my kid,&rdquo; she says hotly, taking the girl by surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with that.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Minutes later, the principal, Paula Holmes, sits Dasani down. &ldquo;I believe you can change, but you&rsquo;re not showing me that,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>Dasani returns to class feeling jaunty. The wrong message &mdash; Chanel&rsquo;s permission, rather than Miss Holmes&rsquo;s prohibition &mdash; has sunk in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ma fight you,&rdquo; she tells another girl. &ldquo;My mother said she&rsquo;ll let me fight.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>With that, Dasani is suspended.</p>

				<p>Miss Holmes knows it is a risky move, but nothing else has worked. The girl needs to be shocked out of her behavior. The alternative is to fail in school and beyond.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Get your things and leave,&rdquo; Miss Holmes tells her.</p>

				<p>Dasani will be out of school for a whole week. She cannot speak.</p>

				<p>To be suspended is to be truly homeless. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph top"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hildren are not the face of New York&rsquo;s homeless. They rarely figure among the panhandlers and bag ladies, war vets and untreated schizophrenics who have long been stock characters in this city of contrasts.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Their homelessness is hidden. They spend their days in school, their nights in shelters. They are seen only in glimpses &mdash; pulling overstuffed suitcases in the shadow of a tired parent, passing for tourists rather than residents without a home.</p>

				<p>Their numbers have risen above anything in the city&rsquo;s modern history, to a staggering 22,091 this month. If all of the city&rsquo;s homeless children were to file into Madison Square Garden for a hockey game, more than 4,800 would not have a seat.</p>

				<p>Yet it is the adult population that drives debates on poverty and homelessness, with city officials and others citing &ldquo;personal responsibility&rdquo; as the central culprit. Children are bystanders in this discourse, no more to blame for their homelessness than for their existence.</p>

				<p>Dasani works to keep her homelessness hidden. She has spent years of her childhood in the punishing confines of the Auburn shelter in Brooklyn, where to be homeless is to be powerless. She and her seven siblings are at the mercy of forces beyond their control: parents who cannot provide, agencies that fall short, a metropolis rived by inequality and indifference.</p>

				<p>The experience has left Dasani internally adrift, for the losses of the homeless child only begin with the home itself. She has had to part with privacy and space &mdash; the kind of quiet that nurtures the mind. She has lost the dignity that comes with living free of vermin and chronic illness. She has fallen behind in school, despite her crackling intelligence.</p>

				<p>She has lost the simplest things that for other children are givens: the freedom of riding a bicycle, the safety of a bathroom not shared with strangers, the ease of being in school without stigma. And from all of these losses has come the departure of faith itself.</p>

				<p>God &ldquo;is somewhere around,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We just can&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>To trust is to be caught off guard.</p>

				<p>Dasani is unmoored by her recent suspension from the Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts. For months, this new school was her only haven. She had grown so attached to her principal, Paula Holmes, that she expected a measure of tolerance despite her outbursts, the kind of forgiveness she never gets at home.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_4_single_2"></div>

				<p>Her forced departure from school overlaps with spring break, plunging Dasani further into the morass of her family&rsquo;s troubles. Her parents&rsquo; resolve to leave Auburn has vanished now that their savings plan fell apart, yet the shelter is pressing the family to leave while offering no assistance in finding a home. Meanwhile, the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services has stepped up its scrutiny of Dasani&rsquo;s parents, who are increasingly despondent.</p>

				<p>As pressure mounts from all sides, Dasani braces herself. She has seen this before &mdash; the storm of familial problems that suddenly gathers force.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tsunami, just spinning around, nothing going right,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Put my life back together!&rsquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Your life doesn&rsquo;t go the way you want it to go.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">O</span>n April 3, Dasani climbs up the steps of McKinney wearing her best cardigan. She lingers in the hallway, keeping an eye on Principal Holmes&rsquo;s door. She is eager to try out the script her mother has drilled into her.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;How was your spring break, Miss Holmes?</p>

				<p>(Pause, wait for Miss Holmes to ask the same question.)</p>

				<p>Oh, it was good. I&rsquo;m staying out of trouble!</p>

				<p>(Wait for Miss Holmes to laugh and then head for the door, showing new determination.)</p>

				<p>Gotta get to class!</p>

				<p>Instead, Dasani hangs back. Too many other students are ahead of her, vying for the principal&rsquo;s attention. In class, she is quiet and focused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new Dasani,&rdquo; observes Officer Jamion Andrews, the security guard, his eyebrow dubiously cocked.</p>

				<p>If she can avoid fights, Dasani tells herself, the rest will fall into place. It is the taunts that she cannot resist. Her body gets &ldquo;hyped.&rdquo; She loses control. And that is precisely the behavior that Roxanne, her counselor at school, is trying to disrupt.</p>

				<p>In those moments, Dasani must learn to breathe in for 10 seconds through her nose and then breathe out for 10 seconds through her mouth. Roxanne demonstrates.</p>

				<p>Dasani practices on her walk home from school.</p>

				<p>The two blocks of sidewalk between McKinney and the shelter can be a minefield. This week, one of Dasani&rsquo;s classmates, Sunita, begins to stalk her along the way. Sunita is a foot taller than Dasani and easily twice her 70 pounds. Their rivalry dates back three years to fourth grade, when Sunita, who lives in the projects, began teasing Dasani about living at Auburn, prompting Dasani, then 9, to throw her first punch.</p>

				<p>For days, rumors have been flying that the two will fight again.</p>

				<p>As school lets out on April 9, Dasani steps onto the sidewalk and is surrounded by a sea of girls.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You gonna fight her?&rdquo; one of them asks breathlessly.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Dasani yells loud enough for Sunita to hear. &ldquo;Miss Holmes says if I get in another fight I get suspended.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani&rsquo;s restraint only emboldens Sunita, who walks up and slaps Dasani hard across her left cheek.</p>

				<p>The crowd is hushed. Dasani tries to breathe.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You think that hurt? I eat those,&rdquo; Dasani says, using one of her mother&rsquo;s put-downs.</p>

				<p>The girl glares at Dasani.</p>

				<p class="lines nobotmarg">Breathe in 10 seconds.</p>

				<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Dasani&rsquo;s 10-year-old sister Avianna jumps between them. &ldquo;You better back up off my sister&rsquo;s face before I hurt you,&rdquo; Avianna yells.</p>

				<p>The girls might as well be twins. They share the same pillow, the same dresser, the same absent, biological father. It is usually Dasani who comes to Avianna&rsquo;s rescue, carrying her up four flights of stairs to their room when her asthma strikes.</p>

				<p>But today, Avianna rises to the occasion, mouthing off fiercely at Sunita as the crowd disperses.</p>

				<p>Dasani is soon surrounded by all of her siblings, a familial force field. Their bond presents itself physically. When they walk, ride the bus, switch trains, climb steps, jump puddles, cross highways and file into Auburn, they move as a single being. In all things, they are one.</p>

				<p>The sheer size of the family draws the notice of strangers, who shoot looks of recrimination at the mother, Chanel.</p>

				<p>Yet she sees fortitude in this small army of siblings, something she and her husband, Supreme, never had growing up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the street became our family,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want the street to become their family, too.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The children&rsquo;s solidarity is striking enough that social workers frequently make note of it. &ldquo;Family close knit,&rdquo; reads one social worker&rsquo;s report in March.</p>

				<p>They live in dread of the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services. They survived their mother&rsquo;s absence for a year and take Supreme&rsquo;s periodic disappearances almost in stride, but they cannot imagine losing one another. They know the foster care system can split up siblings across the city&rsquo;s boroughs. </p>

			<div class="section column">
				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>Dasani is haunted by the thought of losing her baby sister, Lele, who just turned 1 and sometimes calls her Mommy. </p>

				<p>All the children dote on Lele, but Dasani speaks her language, discerning hunger or a wet diaper in the baby&rsquo;s cries. </p>
				</span>

				<p>The 11-year-old girl responds with the instinct of a mother but not the training. She pours artificially sweetened grape juice into Lele&rsquo;s bottle as if it were liquid gold.</p>

				<p>What would happen to Lele in the hands of strangers?</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t know how to take care of babies,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>The children have heard their father&rsquo;s story &mdash; how Supreme was torn from his siblings and years passed before he was reunited with them in the Marcy projects, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Supreme soon left home to join the crack trade.</p>

				<p>By then, another child of the Marcy projects had also escaped. She chose an alternate path.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">&ldquo;I</span> was different, and I don&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; Faith Hester says, standing before her class in early May.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;She is not one to dwell on the past. But today, a student prompts Miss Hester to talk about her education. She was only 16 and living in the Marcy projects when she won a scholarship to SUNY Cortland.</p>

				<p>She packed a large orange suitcase. Her mother refused to take her to the train station. Girls married their way out of the projects. Going to college, the neighbors sneered, was trying to &ldquo;be white.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>So Miss Hester left alone that day, dragging her suitcase along Park Avenue. In college, she cleaned houses to help pay her way. Her mother did not speak to her for six months. &ldquo;Sometimes you have to be alone,&rdquo; she says, looking around the room.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret it for one second,&rdquo; she says, slamming her hand down on a desk. &ldquo;That was the path!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The class is motionless.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo; Miss Hester continues, her voice trembling. &ldquo;There are going to be some places in your life where you feel bizarre. You feel outstanding. And remain that way. Stay just as you are.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani stares at her teacher, mesmerized.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot of courage to be different,&rdquo; Miss Hester says.</p>

				<p>When Dasani looks into the future, she sees who she won&rsquo;t be. She won&rsquo;t be a dropout. She won&rsquo;t do drugs or smoke or drink. She won&rsquo;t get married, unless she finds &ldquo;a gentle man, not a harsh man.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She won&rsquo;t have children unless she can support them. She won&rsquo;t end up on the street.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Spare some change?&rdquo; she says, mocking a panhandler. &ldquo;Nuh-uh. Not me.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>It is harder for Dasani to imagine who she might become. She has been told she must reach for college if she wants a life of choices, but who will pay? Her mother is quick to ask that question whenever Grandma Sherry tries to encourage Dasani with the shining example of a niece who graduated from Bates College in Maine on scholarship.</p>

				<p>Other children talk of becoming rap stars or athletes, escaping their world with one good break. Dasani subscribes to the logic of those fantasies. Her life is defined by extremes. In order to transcend extreme poverty, it follows that she must become extremely rich or extremely something. What exactly she cannot see. To dream is, after all, an act of faith.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dream at all,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Even when I try.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She believes in what she can see, and Miss Hester is real. Her lecture that day leaves Dasani feeling uplifted.</p>

				<p>As she walks home with a classmate later that afternoon, they talk about a coming history project on ancient Egypt. Dasani does not see Sunita coming.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna fight you!&rdquo; Sunita calls out from the underpass, shedding her sweatshirt.</p>

				<p>Dasani pivots and starts walking against the traffic along Tillary Street. This time there are no siblings to come to her rescue.</p>

				<p>Get back on school property, she tells herself. She crosses over toward McKinney as Sunita charges up behind her.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Move before I punch you!&rdquo; Dasani says. But Sunita grabs Dasani&rsquo;s shirt and pulls as Dasani takes a roundhouse swing. They fall to the ground, biting and scratching.</p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>Suddenly, another big girl piles on, kicking Dasani in the face and laughing while Sunita holds her down.</p>

				<p>Somehow Dasani manages to throw Sunita off balance, scrambling on top and pummeling her face before they pull apart, bleeding and crying. </p>
				</span>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying it right in front of your face,&rdquo; Dasani yells, her chest heaving. &ldquo;You wanna fight me some more &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; Sunita yells.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I will jump you in your face!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I want you to! I want you to!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Sunita&rsquo;s brother orders her to retreat. &ldquo;Take your ass in the house!&rdquo; he yells.</p>

				<p>She turns obediently toward the Whitman projects as Dasani runs into Auburn.</p>

				<p>Minutes later, Dasani emerges with Chanel, who heads to the projects ready to go. She will wait for Sunita&rsquo;s mother all night if needed, and they can settle this themselves.</p>

				<p>But as Chanel presses for details, she learns that Dasani is hardly innocent: She had thrown Sunita&rsquo;s book bag on the floor earlier that day and commented unfavorably on her &ldquo;$2.99 sweater.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel cools down and decides to handle the matter at school. The next morning, the two mothers and their daughters meet with Karen Best, an assistant principal who cuts to the chase.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Had Dasani been seriously injured, we wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here having this conversation,&rdquo; Miss Best says. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you need to understand: Children as young as you go to jail. O.K.? Real simple.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The mothers nod. The girls stare at the floor.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She could have had a concussion,&rdquo; Miss Best says. &ldquo;You want to do something? Prove how smart you are.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; Chanel says approvingly.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Everyone knows the negativity,&rdquo; Miss Best says, looking at both girls. &ldquo;You got that down pat. Show the brains.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">B</span>ack at Auburn, nothing is going well. The city&rsquo;s shelters are packed with families, whose average length of stay &mdash; 13.5 months &mdash; is longer than ever.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Dasani&rsquo;s family is among the outliers. It will soon be three years since they landed at Auburn. While the Department of Homeless Services cannot limit a family&rsquo;s time in the shelter system, the agency can resort to punitive measures when residents are found to be uncooperative.</p>

				<p>On May 14, Supreme and Chanel are called to a meeting at Auburn with two agency officials and the family&rsquo;s shelter caseworker.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you: What have you been doing to move out?&rdquo; one of the officials asks Chanel and Supreme in a recording they made of the meeting.</p>

				<p>The official points at the family&rsquo;s independent living plan with the agency.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;You both signed it, O.K.?&rdquo; the official says. &ldquo;It says, &lsquo;This shelter is temporary housing.&rsquo; You must look for permanent housing for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Violating the plan enough times means a family can be given an &ldquo;involuntary discharge,&rdquo; barring them from returning to the city&rsquo;s shelters for 30 days.</p>

				<p>During the meeting, Chanel and Supreme admit they have not searched for apartments. They say there is no point, since they cannot afford city rents without the kind of subsidy that the department once offered. They complain that their room is miserable and ask if they can be transferred to a better shelter.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard,&rdquo; one of the officials says. &ldquo;Listen, you are not the only family in shelter.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Supreme says. &ldquo;Thousands.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Tens of thousands,&rdquo; the official says.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;Right, well, I have a different question,&rdquo; Supreme says. &ldquo;Do y&rsquo;all fall under the guidelines of the New York City Housing standards?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; one of the officials says.</p>

				<p>A few weeks earlier, the family had been walking the elegant streets south of Fort Greene Park, searching &ldquo;white folks&rsquo; trash&rdquo; for discarded books and clothes. A thin, black volume caught Supreme&rsquo;s eye: &ldquo;McKinney&rsquo;s Consolidated Laws of New York &mdash; Book 52 A.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>He began leafing through hundreds of pages of laws, noting the violations that his living arrangement presents: the lack of hygienic conditions, dividers for privacy and sufficient living space.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s inhumane,&rdquo; Supreme mumbles. &ldquo;I think one of you all need to try it. Your husband, eight children, all in one room. No bathroom. I want to see how you all manage that for three years.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>He might as well be talking to himself.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;With the documentation we can move forward, O.K.?&rdquo; one of the officials says.</p>

				<p>Supreme seems not to hear her either.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You never got no peace of mind. You and your husband can never have a moment because your children are always in your face. You&rsquo;d go crazy!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The meeting is wrapping up.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Even now, they got the bathrooms closed, so where you gotta go? All the way to the next floor,&rdquo; Supreme continues. &ldquo;I got a child who is legally blind. I gotta monitor her every time she go to the bathroom. It&rsquo;s, like, bananas. It&rsquo;s really bananas.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">T</span>he children&rsquo;s birthdays come in a mad springtime rush: Lele&rsquo;s in March, Avianna&rsquo;s in April, the remaining six in the span of three and a half weeks.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Expectations are calibrated based on where a birthday falls in the monthly cash flow. Those at the start of the month bring hope, while those at the end of the month are luckless. So it goes for Avianna. </p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_4_single_4"></div>

				<p>Supreme hands her $11, one for each year of her life, but the next day, he asks for $5 back. She waits for a cake. Days pass. Finally, the children give up and light two small candles. Like carolers, they hold them beneath Avianna&rsquo;s face and sing.</p>

				<p>Avianna savors everything. While her siblings inhale their food, she will linger over each French fry.</p>

				<p>She spends her $6 slowly. A week later, she takes her last dollar bill and folds it delicately, like a Japanese fan. She then places it inside a homemade card that Chanel opens on Mother&rsquo;s Day.</p>

				<p>They pass that afternoon at the laundromat. There is only $190 left on Chanel&rsquo;s debit card, the balance of a tax refund that was supposed to rescue them from the shelter.</p>

				<p>In times like these, Chanel sees fit to steal groceries. She tells the children to wait for her at a store&rsquo;s entrance. She hides the habit from them. They hide their knowingness from her.</p>

				<p>Except for Papa, a gaptoothed 5-year-old buzzing with energy.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You stealin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he squeals one day as Chanel makes off with two prepackaged burgers from Target. &ldquo;You crazy!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Shut up, man!&rdquo; Chanel says, before composing herself.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she tries more softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right to steal. But God knows when it&rsquo;s for a good reason.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>This year, birthday season has the misfortune of colliding with four of the children&rsquo;s grade-school graduations. They need new outfits, and money for class photos and parties. Chanel is accustomed to saying no when she has to, but she also recognizes the small luxuries that will separate her children from their peers.</p>

				<p>By the time Dasani&rsquo;s birthday arrives at the end of May, she knows better than to expect $1 for each of her 12 years.</p>

				<p>She has already pressed her mother too many times to pay for a school trip to Washington. Dasani has never been farther than Pennsylvania. She will hold out for that and let the birthday pass quietly.</p>

				<p>Chanel has no such intention. Dasani is her jewel.</p>

				<p>Over the weekend, the family retreats to the rowhouse in East New York belonging to Grandma Sherry. The mood is light. The children skip about as Supreme stands over the stove, tending to his honey-barbecue wings.</p>

				<p>The time has come to sing. Chanel gently lifts a vanilla sheet cake out of its plastic casing as Dasani stares in wonder. The top of the cake is still blank, awaiting inscription. Her mother covers it with candles and dims the lights.</p>

				<p>Dasani closes her eyes.</p>

				<p>If I could grant you three wishes, what would they be? her school counselor once asked her.</p>

				<p>A house of our own, a lot of money and three more wishes, was Dasani&rsquo;s answer.</p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>She blows out the candles as the children clap. </p>

				<p>Chanel fetches a long, serrated knife. &ldquo;Let me show you how to cut a cake,&rdquo; she says, gingerly placing her hand over Dasani&rsquo;s. Together, they move the knife through the buttercream frosting. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>Dasani bestows a sugar-flowered slice on each of her siblings, taking a plain piece for herself. </p>

				<p>They race to the basement, where their two uncles are blasting the Black Eyed Peas. </p>
				</span>

				<p>Screaming in delight, Dasani and her sisters leap onto a rickety, wooden platform and dance beneath a disco ball to &ldquo;I Gotta Feeling&rdquo; as Papa bounces around them.</p>

				<p>They barely register the hard-faced young men shuffling through the basement, exchanging elaborate handshakes, their heads hung low. Some play video games. Others mill about with girls in their teens wearing too much makeup and too little clothing.</p>

				<p>One of these girls, a baby-faced Dominican who works at the supermarket across the street, hangs on Uncle Josh, flashing braces when she smiles. To curry favor, she hands Dasani a $20 bill as a birthday present.</p>

				<p>Like other things in her life, Dasani could not have predicted such luck. She is still giddy, long after the girl has left in a huff, offended by Josh&rsquo;s waning interest.</p>

				<p>It is now late and the other children have collapsed on a sagging beige couch. Dasani is dancing to Alicia Keys.</p>

				<p class="lines">She&rsquo;s living in a world and it&rsquo;s on fire</p>
				<p class="lines">Filled with catastrophe</p>
				<p class="lines nobotmarg">But she knows she can fly away</p>

				<p>Dasani reaches up, her arms bathed in blinking lights, as if saluting an imaginary audience.</p>

				<p class="lines">Oh, she got her head in the clouds</p>
				<p class="lines">And she&rsquo;s not backing down</p>
				<p class="lines nobotmarg">This girl is on fire.</p>

				<p>Dasani has never had a better birthday. It feels like perfection.</p>

				<p>It hardly matters that the cake was stolen from Pathmark.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">T</span>hree days later, it is raining as the children spill down Sherry&rsquo;s steps. They are hungry and short on sleep.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;In theory, they are heading to the thing they most need &mdash; psychotherapy. Chanel signed them up after learning that she can reap $10 per child in carfare through Medicaid, at a clinic in the Kensington section of Brooklyn.</p>

				<p>Chanel needs the cash. She is still hoping to find a way to send Dasani on her school trip to Washington, and the $75 deposit is due tomorrow. So despite the pelting rain, Chanel instructs the children to meet her at a subway station.</p>

				<p>Only Hada is wearing a raincoat. Papa&rsquo;s hoodie slips off as he tips back to catch raindrops on his tongue. The children cross Lincoln Avenue holding hands.</p>

				<p>Dasani is in a foul mood. There is no telling how her anger will reveal itself today. Sometimes it comes as a quiet kind of rage. She will stare at an indefinite point, her eyes blinking, her mouth set. Other times, it bursts like thunder.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Move it!&rdquo; she screams.</p>

				<p>Nijai trails behind, her glasses fogging over. She has always been the odd orchid in this bunch of daisies, the most delicate and sensitive child, made more frail by her advancing blindness.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_4_single_5"></div>

				<p>She can make out only vague shapes and colors. Soon she will have to use a cane, but for now she often rests a hand on Lele&rsquo;s stroller to guide her. Today, Lele and the stroller have been left at Sherry&rsquo;s.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I said move it!&rdquo; Dasani yells at Nijai.</p>

				<p>She starts shoving Nijai, harder and harder, knocking her sister into a metal fence. Then she punches her in the arm. &ldquo;You stupid!&rdquo; Dasani screams. &ldquo;You think you smart, but you stupid! Now keep walking!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Nijai begins to sob as Khaliq yells, &ldquo;Double up!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>In pairs, they sprint across a six-lane highway and enter the Grant Avenue subway station, ducking under the turnstile to meet their mother. After they board the A train, she hands them a bag of lukewarm Popeyes chicken, furnished by a stranger.</p>

				<p>By the time they get off at Jay Street, their stomachs are full and the mood is lifted. Dasani spots an umbrella on the ground. It still works, opening to reveal an intricate pattern of white and black flecks. She twirls it around and, when the 103 bus pulls up, carefully closes it.</p>

				<p>Dasani and Nijai race to the back of the bus, where the motor keeps the seats warm. They sit pressed together, newly reconciled. Dasani is soon asleep. The little ones watch, thumbs in mouth, as their mother closes her eyes. Every time the bus slows, she snaps awake.</p>

				<p>At Church Avenue, the children and their mother pile off. The street looks familiar, but Chanel is unsure.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We got off at the wrong stop,&rdquo; Dasani announces.</p>

				<p>Chanel fixes her gaze on Dasani.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Shut the fuck up,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You know, that&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t like about you &mdash; your negativity. You always talkin&rsquo; about the problem. You got a solution?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani carries a singular burden among her siblings. Chanel has vested enormous authority in Dasani. Her competence, agility and strength &mdash; the attributes that could rescue Dasani from her life&rsquo;s miseries &mdash; also threaten to keep her mired in the problems that her mother cannot meet alone.</p>

				<p> At times, Chanel seems taunted by her dependence on her daughter, which reminds her of her own failings.</p>

				<p>They walk single file toward Coney Island Avenue.</p>

				<p>Dasani tries to recover.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Mommy,&rdquo; she says, gesturing hopefully toward a florist shop. They take a few steps before Chanel turns on her heel, remembering the way.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;If you want to go somewhere, don&rsquo;t listen to Dasani,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>Dasani freezes under her new umbrella.</p>

				<p>Chanel unloads.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of your attitude,&rdquo; she seethes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only like 15 kids going on this trip because people can&rsquo;t pay. And me, who got nothing, is trying to send you and you gonna give me attitude?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani keeps walking.</p>

				<p>Chanel&rsquo;s fury mounts. She reaches for the same words every time, the kind that echo for days in Dasani&rsquo;s head.</p>

				<p><em>Dasani always gotta have the answer.</em></p>

				<p><em>She think she special.</em></p>

				<p><em>She think she some-fucking-body.</em></p>

				<p><em>She nobody.</em></p>

				<p>Dasani&rsquo;s face remains frozen as the tears begin to fall, like rain on a statue.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_4_single_6"></div>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit if she&rsquo;s crying,&rdquo; Chanel says loudly as they approach a small green house, marked by a gold-embossed sign that reads &ldquo;Advanced Psychotherapy & Behavioral Health Services.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one goddamn chief,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only chief.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Inside, the children file into their fourth &ldquo;group therapy&rdquo; session with a woman who asks vague questions like, &ldquo;What are your hobbies?&rdquo; She sounds more like a distant aunt than a counselor.</p>

				<p>Khaliq knows the difference. Earlier in the year, a Children&rsquo;s Services caseworker had sent him to a therapist after he acted erratically in school. That therapist had asked questions like, &ldquo;Do you want to kill yourself?&rdquo; Those sessions felt like they never ended; these lasted only 20 minutes &mdash; roughly two and a half minutes per child.</p>

				<p>At the door, Chanel collects her $80 in carfare and the children head back into the rain. The cash instantly settles the family, leaving the children calm and Chanel introspective.</p>

				<p>By the time they reach the bus stop, Chanel&rsquo;s gray T-shirt is soaked through. She is thinking about Supreme, whom she could not rouse from bed this morning.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What gets me down is the responsibility,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They got shoes on but no socks. I come all this way, on the bus, in the rain, to get the money so she can go on her trip.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She is shivering now.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Those are the things you are supposed to provide,&rdquo; she scolds her absent husband. &ldquo;You are the man. You made this family, but you don&rsquo;t provide.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani watches her mother silently. She wants to fix it.</p>

				<p>She can only feel empty. The day&rsquo;s weight has passed from her sister to herself and now to their mother, who is weeping in the rain.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph top"><span class="pov_first_letter">A</span> mob of spectators presses in, trying to see the tiny girl. Rap stars circle. The cameras roll. The crowd chants her name.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Da-Sa-Neee!&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Her heart is racing. She looks up at the sky and extends her fingers, but cannot reach high enough to grasp the metal bar. A powerful man hoists her up by the waist.</p>

				<p>In an instant, she is midair, pulling and twisting acrobatically as the audience gasps at the might of this 12-year-old girl.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a giantess,&rdquo; the man had announced to the audience. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s tomorrow&rsquo;s success, I&rsquo;m telling you right now.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani blinks, looking out at the smiling faces. She cannot make sense of the serendipity that has brought her here to Harlem, on this sparkling July day, to make her debut as a member of an urban fitness group teamed up with Nike.</p>

				<p>But there is her beaming mother, Chanel; her father, Supreme; and all seven siblings. They are cheering and clapping as well.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a dream &mdash; make believe &mdash; like this wasn&rsquo;t happening,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You know, like in movies, people pinch themselves like this ain&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>It was only two months earlier that Dasani stood at the bus stop as her mother wept in the rain. Summer was fast approaching, a season that, in this family, always brings change.</p>

				<p>The markers of Dasani&rsquo;s life &mdash; her first months in the care of Grandma Joanie, the day her family moved into their first real home, the loss of that home two years later, when they landed in the Auburn shelter &mdash; these all came in summertime.</p>

				<p>There was no telling what this summer might bring. Dasani could no sooner predict landing a spot on the Harlem team than she could foretell the abrupt changes that still lay ahead.</p>

				<p>Already, the court-mandated supervision of the family by child protection workers had run its course. Chanel&rsquo;s nine-month trial period was suddenly over, leaving her custody secure, just as new problems came along.</p>

				<p>School was winding down when the children learned that their only other refuge &mdash; Grandma Sherry&rsquo;s rowhouse in East New York, Brooklyn &mdash; had gone into foreclosure. Sherry could end up homeless as well, at a time when New York&rsquo;s shelter population had surpassed a historic 50,000.</p>

				<p>As the days grew hotter, Dasani and her family remained stuck in the same miserable room at Auburn.</p>

				<p>And yet summer, no matter how stifling, also carried a certain promise, the kind that comes of chance encounters on the street.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">I</span>t is a muggy night in Harlem, but the children do not care. They savor any chance to visit.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;This is the place where, a decade earlier, Chanel and Supreme fell in love. They have returned over the years, pulled by the Five Percent Nation, the movement spawned 50 years ago by a contemporary of Malcolm X who broke from the Nation of Islam.</p>

				<p>Tonight, people swarm into the Harriet Tubman Learning Center on West 127th Street for the organization&rsquo;s annual gathering, pushing past security guards and a vendor with pins that declare, &ldquo;I &hearts; being God.&rdquo; Supreme mills about in the foyer, greeting old friends with tight hugs.</p>

				<p>Chanel trails him, her chin high, her daughters&rsquo; hair freshly braided. </p>

				<p>It is a rare moment of belonging in a year of rootlessness. </p>
				</span>

				<p>As the sun sets, Dasani and her family step out for some air. A man brushes past them, walking along West 127th Street. His hooded sweatshirt is pulled low over his face, which is dusted by a salt-and-pepper beard. He moves with the purposeful air of a celebrity in hiding.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I seen your videos,&rdquo; Chanel says, stopping him in his tracks.</p>

				<p>For years, Dasani&rsquo;s family had been watching the DVDs of this former convict turned fitness guru who calls himself Giant. His team, Bartendaz, combines pull-up acrobatics on city playgrounds with a militaristic message of self-improvement, steering followers away from drugs and alcohol to &ldquo;the bars of health.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Giant looks Chanel up and down, noting the open beer she has sheathed in a brown paper bag.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Bud don&rsquo;t make you wiser,&rdquo; he observes, flashing a smile that reveals a perfect row of teeth.</p>

				<p>Chanel ignores the comment. She is already thinking through the possibilities presented by this accidental meeting. She steers Dasani to some empty pull-up bars at a nearby playground.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Show him what ya got!&rdquo; she calls out.</p>

				<p>Giant, whose name is Hassan Yasin-Bradley, accepts the impromptu audition the way a famous film director takes the waiter&rsquo;s latest screenplay. While Giant remains on the fringe of prime-time America, he has his share of acolytes in Harlem.</p>

				<p>Dasani springs to the bars and begins to knock out an impressive set of pull-ups, her shoulders popping with the muscles of an action figure.</p>

				<p>Giant is still chatting with Chanel when he looks over and pauses.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>Chanel senses that she may be on to something. She explains that Dasani has been doing pull-ups in Fort Greene Park for years. She can also dance, do gymnastics, run track. All she lacks is training &mdash; of any kind.</p>

				<p>Now it is Giant&rsquo;s mind that races through the possibilities. The girl is uncommonly strong. She has a telegenic smile. She&rsquo;s spunky.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;She seems like just the kind of girl we could use on our team,&rdquo; he says, grinning at Dasani, who grins back.</p>

				<p>Giant quickly explains how his team works: It has a limited partnership with Nike that will hopefully lead to bigger things. In the meantime, the team earns modest pay in exchange for holding training clinics, and performing at concerts and other events.</p>

				<p>At the very least, he concludes, Dasani merits a proper tryout.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Meet me at the park next Saturday,&rdquo; he says, leaving his number before disappearing.</p>

				<p>Dasani lies awake that night.</p>

				<p>It is the first time in her life she can see a path to something else. What exactly, she is not sure. She has not even had her tryout. But for a girl who has spent her life tempering expectations, she cannot stop herself from dreaming just a little.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ma save all my money so we can get a house,&rdquo; she tells her mother.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Use your money for you,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be O.K.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dasani insists. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ma save all my money.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">M</span>oney is especially tight. This might explain why, in Dasani&rsquo;s words, Mommy goes &ldquo;loco&rdquo; during an inspection of the family&rsquo;s room at Auburn.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;There is a knock at the door. Chanel lets in the inspector, who promptly demands that she surrender the family&rsquo;s forbidden microwave oven.</p>

				<p>Chanel refuses. She cannot afford to buy a new one, nor can she fathom having to wait in line every night to reheat 10 dinner trays in one of the shelter&rsquo;s two microwaves. The inspector leaves, and by the time two security officers with the Department of Homeless Services arrive to confiscate the microwave, Chanel has hidden it in a friend&rsquo;s room.</p>

				<p>As for the inspector, Chanel offers to &ldquo;punch that bitch in the face.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani believes that her mother&rsquo;s biggest problem is her mouth.</p>

				<p>She reflects on this as her homeroom teacher, Faith Hester, delivers a lesson that week on personal responsibility.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever wanna hear, &lsquo;Well, my mother told me to do this,&rsquo; unless you know that that&rsquo;s the right thing,&rdquo; Miss Hester tells the class.</p>

				<p>The teacher has shimmied into an empty desk next to Dasani.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_5_single_1"></div>

				<p>&ldquo;I am telling you, as sure as I&rsquo;m sitting here,&rdquo; Miss Hester says, her arm resting across Dasani&rsquo;s desk, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re gonna be held responsible for the choices you make.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Hands shoot up in the air.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Dasani?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani recounts how her longtime rival, Sunita, began following her after school, and slapped her. &ldquo;And so, my mom is a violent parent, so you can&rsquo;t tell her anything about fights because then she gonna want to get a stick and tell you to knock the chick out.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Miss Hester arches her brows.</p>

				<p> &ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; Miss Hester says. &ldquo;Now, let me ask you: Do you think that was the right thing to do?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The class erupts in chaos.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;O.K., O.K.!&rdquo; Miss Hester yells. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ma tell you what I would have told my kid.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>They fall silent.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Not everybody has something to lose,&rdquo; Miss Hester says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You care about your life,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;There are people out there who are so hurt they don&rsquo;t care about leaving here. They are looking for an opportunity to do something crazy and ridiculous. They have nothing to live for.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani ponders this.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I am telling you to listen to your internal barometer,&rdquo; Miss Hester says. &ldquo;Think about your next move before you make your next move.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani is still in bed the next morning when her mother rises from a fitful sleep and heads to the corner store with her sister Avianna. All around, men are leaving the projects to report to early work shifts. Chanel stands in the cold, watching them. &ldquo;Your father should be doing that,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>Just that week she had stopped a flag waver at a construction site. It seemed like a job that Chanel could perform beautifully. The woman told her about an organization that helps people with G.E.D.&rsquo;s find work.</p>

				<p>For Chanel, words like &ldquo;G.E.D.&rdquo; end a conversation. It has been 20 years since she sat in a high school classroom. She can feel like a foreigner in her own country, unable to speak the language of bank accounts and loan applications. When filling out medical forms, she stops at the box requiring a work number, frozen by its blankness.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I want my kids to be able to come see me at my job, pick up my paycheck,&rdquo; she says that afternoon, standing with Dasani outside Au Bon Pain, where the day&rsquo;s pastries will soon sell at a discount. &ldquo;Just be reliant on my money, you know what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani stares at her mother anxiously.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of my kids seeing me dull,&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my time to shine.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see you dull,&rdquo; Dasani says quietly. &ldquo;I see you shine.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani spends the week before her tryout for Bartendaz in focused preparation, training on the fitness bars next to the basketball court in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. At night, she replays the team&rsquo;s DVDs over and over, studying the members closely.</p>

				<p>At school, she tells no one.</p>

				<p>This new dream is carried on practical terms. It is less about helping herself than about making her parents whole. In the meantime, Dasani worries about the most immediate challenge, which is to get to Harlem on time. Punctuality is a miracle in her family.</p>

				<p>On Saturday morning, there is no sign of Dasani as the Bartendaz start to warm up at the playground at 144th Street and Lenox Avenue.</p>

				<p>Soon they are causing a commotion that slows the traffic. One after another, they fly onto the bars, whipping through moves that seem to defy gravity. Some of them wear black T-shirts with the logo of a man bending a bar, his brain lit by a bulb.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Salute that mind!&rdquo; Giant calls out to his followers.</p>

				<p>There is Cinderblock, Honey Bee, Sky, Earth, Water, Blaq Ninja, Salubrious and Mel Matrix. Giant&rsquo;s second in command is Dr. Good Body, a self-described athletic alchemist (&ldquo;the library is my alma mater&rdquo;) who transforms the &ldquo;base metal&rdquo; of a person&rsquo;s character into &ldquo;gold.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Giant orbits around his team, issuing commands in a lyrical code that is impenetrable to outsiders. He is especially fond of abbreviations. A favorite is &ldquo;C.A.P.&rdquo; &mdash; Character, Attitude and Personality. His nickname, Giant, stands for Growing Is a Noble Thing.</p>

				<p>It is a bold name for a man who stands just 5-foot-7. Born Warren Hassan Bradley, he grew up in the Baruch projects on the Lower East Side, where in his teens he became known as a D.J. and street fighter skilled at hiding razors in his mouth and spitting them out in combat. He started selling drugs, and was sent to prison in 1989 on two felony drug charges.</p>

				<p>Like Dasani&rsquo;s father, Giant left prison transformed. He had earned a high school equivalency diploma and devoted himself to Islam. (He looks askance at the teachings of the Five Percent.) He also found a way to capitalize on the pull-up bar routines that he taught himself in prison yards. By the time he started Bartendaz in 2003, he was already drawing crowds to Harlem&rsquo;s playgrounds.</p>

				<p>Dasani finally arrives, her mother and two siblings in tow, as the team&rsquo;s practice winds down. Dressed in bright-pink shorts and matching flip-flops, she is a dwarf among titans.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name again?&rdquo; Giant says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Dasani.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Dasani with a D?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Like the water,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>He turns to the group.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Everyone say, &lsquo;Peace, Queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Peace, Queen!&rdquo; they shout.</p>

				<p>The tryout begins with a set of pull-ups, demonstrated by Blaq Ninja and Sky. Dasani coasts through the exercise.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; a team member says as the others whistle. Giant remains cool to the newcomer, telling Dasani &ldquo;stay there, breathe&rdquo; as she pedals her feet in the air while holding her head level with the bar.</p>

				<p>Her next test comes on the parallel bars, where she knocks out a set of dips in good form, and then pedals again as Giant counts aloud, shaking his head incredulously. Next, they hit the floor for push-ups. </p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_5_single_2"></div>

				<p>&ldquo;Do some diamonds!&rdquo; Chanel calls out. Dasani connects her hands in the shape of a diamond as she dives into a set of flawless push-ups.</p>

				<p>Then she goes for broke, clapping her hands behind her back, mid-push-up. Honey Bee captures the image on the team&rsquo;s iPad before Dasani comes crashing to the ground, promptly dusting herself off.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Look at this! Look at this!&rdquo; Giant says, running over to show Dasani the iPad photo. &ldquo;You tellin&rsquo; me I can&rsquo;t sell this poster for $100?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>He turns to Chanel: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>A young boy sidles up. The team has drawn spectators who live as far away as Norway and Japan. This one is a local.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he says to Dasani. &ldquo;Can you do a pull-up again?&rdquo;</p>

				<p>She nods gamely as he calls out to his friends: &ldquo;Yo! Come here! She about to do it!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Giant smiles.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Wait till they see you in three weeks,&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>The family is ecstatic.</p>

				<p>Supreme runs to the corner store for a dozen roses. He hands them to Chanel.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Dag, I love it here,&rdquo; he says, looking at her tenderly. &ldquo;We should come back to Harlem.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hanel soon finds reason to be suspicious of Giant. He is charming, she thinks, but confusing on details like payment and a promised contract. Giant, too, can spot a hustler, and he seems wary of Chanel.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;On the day of the tryout, he treats her children to lunch at a local bodega, joined by Malcolm X&rsquo;s grandson Malik, a friend of the team. Malik congratulates Dasani, handing her a bottle of peach-flavored Snapple. She carries the bottle with both hands, later writing &ldquo;Malcolm X grandson&rdquo; on the label before stashing it in her dresser at Auburn.</p>

				<p>The next day, when Dasani&rsquo;s siblings tag along to practice again, Giant senses that Chanel expects him to repeat the invitation.</p>

				<p>He skips the meal, but reassures Chanel that her daughter, like his other team members, will be compensated for events. The first one is a training clinic this Thursday. All Chanel needs to do is bring Dasani. The rest is Dasani&rsquo;s job.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we got the word &lsquo;responsibility,&rsquo;&rdquo; Giant tells Dasani in front of Chanel. &ldquo;Response&rdquo; &mdash; he holds up his right hand &mdash; &ldquo;Ability&rdquo; &mdash; then his left hand. &ldquo;So respond to what? Your ability. Not your mom&rsquo;s ability.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>On Thursday afternoon, Dasani asks if her mother has heard from Giant. Chanel is tired after a long day and cannot imagine taking Dasani all the way to Harlem.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;He never called,&rdquo; Chanel tells Dasani.</p>

				<p>Up in Harlem, Giant had been calling repeatedly. He checks his phone, looking for a response. He shakes his head.</p>

				<p> Dasani goes to sleep feeling crushed.</p>

				<p>She wakes at 5 a.m. for the long-awaited school trip to Washington. Still feeling glum, she boards the bus on an empty stomach, sitting alone with a thin blue blanket laid carefully across her legs. Five hours later, as they approach the Capitol, Dasani presses her face to the window.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_5_single_5"></div>

				<p>It looks different here. People walk slower. There is space everywhere &mdash; trees, monuments, water. She can see off into the distance, her view unobstructed by skyscrapers.</p>

				<p>She is paying special attention, trying to record what she sees so she can describe it later to her sister Nijai.</p>

				<p>Remember every single detail, Nijai had implored. It is not just that her blindness prevents her from seeing it herself. It is that Washington represents Nijai&rsquo;s roots, the city where she was born and last saw her mother alive.</p>

				<p>Every detail.</p>

				<p>After a tour of the memorials, the bus stops near the White House. Dasani runs to the tall, wrought-iron gate and looks between the bars. On the sidewalk, a group of protesters wearing orange suits and black hoods are chanting foreign-sounding names.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Obama, close Guant&aacute;namo!&rdquo; they yell.</p>

				<p>Dasani has never heard of Guant&aacute;namo. But she knows what a jail uniform looks like from visiting her Uncle Carnell. These people, she concludes, are supposed to be prisoners, and they want President Obama to close their jail. She shakes her head.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they protesting in front of Obama&rsquo;s house like he gonna be in here,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>There is hardly a trace of the child who had once scoured Gracie Mansion for a glimpse of the mayor. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">A</span> week has passed with no word from Giant. Dasani keeps doing her pull-ups. Tucked in the top drawer of her dresser is the empty Snapple bottle given to her by Malcolm X&rsquo;s grandson.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Dasani tells her mother. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get attached.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Detachment is as much a rite of Dasani&rsquo;s summers as sunbaked afternoons in the park. She bids farewell to Miss Hester and the principal, Paula Holmes, bracing herself for a 10-week absence from the Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts.</p>

				<p>Summers also bring more regular visits to Grandma Sherry&rsquo;s, where the children can ride up and down Lincoln Avenue on rusted bikes. But this year, Sherry has bad news. The bank is coming for her house. In another month, a court marshal will see her out the door if she is not gone.</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_5_single_3"></div>

				<p>Sherry has two bad choices: She can enter the shelter system or she can leave her children and grandchildren behind in New York and move in with her sister in Pittsburgh. If Sherry leaves, Chanel will have lost her only support, the woman who partly raised her.</p>

				<p>Chanel copes in a way that puzzles Sherry: She stops taking Sherry&rsquo;s calls. It is Chanel&rsquo;s way of detaching, of leaving a relationship before it leaves her. Sherry finally decides to go to Pittsburgh. When she does get the children on the phone, she tells them that she is not sure when she is leaving, but that &ldquo;the Lord will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>In the midst of this, Dasani finds herself thinking about Bartendaz. A month after her tryout, she resolves to give it another chance: She will report to practice by herself, as if nothing has changed. But as she announces her departure one morning, Supreme stops her at the door.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Not before this place is straightened up,&rdquo; he says. By the time Dasani finishes, practice is over.</p>

				<p>The next morning, she gets up feeling defiant. She looks at Supreme, who is still asleep. <em>How you gonna take my destiny away from me?</em> she thinks. Dasani turns to her mother, and Chanel waves at her to leave before he wakes.</p>

				<p>Accompanied by her siblings Khaliq and Avianna, she jumps the train to Harlem.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Long time no see,&rdquo; Giant says by way of a greeting. He gives Dasani a stern lecture: &ldquo;If you know you&rsquo;re not gonna be consistent, then I need to know so I can invest in someone else.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani is confused. Her parents say that he never called. His version of events is quite the opposite, but he thinks it best to simply say that &ldquo;there must have been a miscommunication.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Dasani does not know what to believe, but she begins training with Giant every weekend, accompanied by her twin in all things, Avianna.</p>

				<p>They are in Harlem on the day a moving truck pulls up to Sherry&rsquo;s house. Alerted by phone, Chanel arrives moments before Sherry&rsquo;s departure.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ma hide in the truck,&rdquo; 8-year-old Maya says.</p>

				<p>Chanel walks through the house she has known since she was born. She pauses at the bathroom&rsquo;s worn wooden door, which reminds her of her father.</p>

				<p>He is there at that door, some flicker of a memory. Those are the things one loses with a house, not the shelter itself but the irretrievable belonging it brings.</p>

				<p>On the stoop, Sherry and Chanel hold each other for a long time.</p>

				<p>Dasani does not get to say goodbye. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">T</span>he sadness of Sherry&rsquo;s departure is eclipsed a week later when Dasani makes her big Bartendaz debut. Her routine is captured on video for the opening sequence of Giant&rsquo;s forthcoming DVD, and Dasani receives her first earnings: $70.</p>

				<p>She is too excited to think twice when Supreme asks if he can borrow some of it. He buys pizza for the children and keeps the rest. Dasani is distracted by the day&rsquo;s other gifts &mdash; the cheering crowd, the chance to pose with the rappers Jadakiss and Styles P.</p>

				<p>She is still floating two days later, when Giant summons her to a basketball clinic for boys. He wants her to &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; them. It seems like an odd request for a girl who was recently suspended from school. But that is Giant&rsquo;s point: She needs to act like a mentor before she can feel like one.</p>

				<p>She soon takes to the task, guiding boys several inches taller as they struggle into feeble pull-ups. When Dasani orders them to line up, one of the boys smirks, saying, &ldquo;You not staff.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Oh yes I am,&rdquo; Dasani shoots back.</p>

				<p>She is bonding with her team &mdash; most of all with Sky, a nursing student, and Earth, who just got her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in psychology at Queens College.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ma take all of Sky&rsquo;s moves,&rdquo; Dasani says jauntily as she hits the low bars. They laugh and laugh, never ceasing to delight in their youngest member. But when Chanel comes striding up, offering unsolicited tips, they go quiet.</p>

				<p>Later that afternoon, Dasani tells Giant about her loan to Supreme. Long after she leaves practice, he is still livid. Can this even work, he wonders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fixing a child to send back to broken parents.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">S</span>ummer&rsquo;s end marks the third anniversary of Dasani&rsquo;s arrival at Auburn, on Aug. 26, 2010.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Three years &mdash; a quarter of her life &mdash; most of it spent in one room. She has gotten so used to the smallness of it that she can scarcely recall how to live with more space.</p>

				<p>To Dasani, sometimes it seems like only tragedy brings change.</p>

				<p>The next morning, on Aug. 27, she wakes to a high-pitched scream. It is her neighbor in Room 445, a single mother named Aisha. Her 3-month-old daughter, Casshanae, has turned blue.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;My baby&rsquo;s not breathing!&rdquo; she wails.</p>

				<p>A petite 27-year-old from Pennsylvania, Aisha had come to Auburn in early May, seven months pregnant with Casshanae. She was born premature with respiratory distress syndrome and developed feeding problems, all of which was noted in the records that Auburn received.</p>

				<p>The infant&rsquo;s problems were serious enough that a hospital social worker asked the Department of Homeless Services to transfer the baby, Aisha and her 1-year-old son to another shelter equipped to handle medical needs.</p>

				<p>The agency declined to do so, even after Aisha filed a complaint that a male resident had sexually assaulted her in her room at Auburn on June 18.</p>

				<p>Nor did the shelter&rsquo;s staff members heed Aisha&rsquo;s repeated complaints when they gave her a damaged metal crib for the infant, with a loosefitting sheet and a mattress permanently stuck in the lowest position.</p>

				<p>But now she is screaming, and everyone hears her.</p>

				<p>A security guard calls 911. None of the staff members try to resuscitate the baby, even though they are certified in CPR. Aisha fumbles to breathe air into her baby&rsquo;s lungs as paramedics rush into the lobby.</p>

				<p>They race to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where a doctor pronounces Casshanae dead at 8:10 a.m.</p>

				<p>Later that morning, Aisha returns to the fourth floor to pack her things. Her screams rattle the shelter again.</p>

				<p>As she leaves, Dasani lingers by the door. She hears a security guard telling a superior that Aisha left the children alone the previous night. The official asks the guard to file a report. Dasani shudders and closes the door. That will never happen to Baby Lele, she tells herself.</p>

				<p>The next day, the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services takes custody of Aisha&rsquo;s son pending the results of an investigation into the baby&rsquo;s death. Soon after, Dasani sees inspectors walking through the shelter as new cribs are delivered to residents and crib-safety posters are slipped under doors.</p>

				<p>Aisha is summoned back to Auburn by investigators from the medical examiner&rsquo;s office. At their request, she re-enacts the morning of her baby&rsquo;s death, when she says she found Casshanae lifeless in the crib. They take pictures of the crib, its sheet still crumpled. An autopsy was unable to determine the cause of death. </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">D</span>asani tries not to think about the dead baby.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Her room is sweltering. The children want nothing more than to get out and cool off. They put on their bathing suits. They have gone swimming only once this summer.</p>

				<p>First, they stop into Chanel&rsquo;s methadone clinic in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a dim brick building sandwiched between a highway overpass and a garbage dump. Chanel waves at Dasani to come inside.</p>

				<p>She has been bragging to the staff about Giant, who continues to work with Dasani on the condition that she is paid in kind, not cash. &ldquo;No one can take a pair of sneakers,&rdquo; he reasons. &ldquo;He just stingy,&rdquo; Chanel says. But she has gone along with it, proud as a stage mother.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;So look out for Dasani, man,&rdquo; Chanel tells a woman behind the desk. &ldquo;She gonna be out soon.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I believe I am already out,&rdquo; Dasani says.</p>

				<p>Chanel leads her children three more blocks to the same Depression-era building where she passed her summers as a child.</p>

				<p>They carry one thin towel to share. </p>

				<p>Dasani squints at the Olympic-size pool, a turquoise expanse that glistens in the sun. She dives in first. All is cool and silent. </p>

				<p>She comes up for air, releasing a rapturous cry.</p>
				</span>

				<p>The uncertainty of Dasani&rsquo;s life is deepening. Supreme is now gone, having checked into a residential treatment program to try to get off methadone.</p>

				<p>Right before school starts in September, Chanel uproots Dasani from McKinney, reasoning that she will be less likely to fight in the company of Avianna and Nijai at a neighboring school.</p>

				<p>Dasani is unsettled. Every afternoon, the three sisters turn up at McKinney like stray puppies, passing the time with Miss Holmes and Miss Hester. The principal offers to enroll all of them. Finally, on Sept. 25, Chanel relents.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Oh my gooney goo hoo,&rdquo; Miss Hester squeals as Dasani, Avianna and Nijai skip up the hallway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been praying on this.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Back at Auburn, residents begin to notice small changes. In the wake of Casshanae&rsquo;s death, the shelter is providing a steadier supply of formula, diapers and other items to mothers, and the cafeteria has a few more items on its menu.</p>

				<p>These fixes hardly address the systemic breakdown that state inspectors are uncovering. On Oct. 1, they inform the Department of Homeless Services of a <a href="#" class="nytmm_link_media nytmm_link_doc doc_inspection_letter"><span class="document_icon"></span>devastating litany of violations</a>.</p>

				<p>The fire safety system is virtually inoperable. The shelter has no certificate of occupancy. Its record-keeping is a mess. The registration cards of 25 of its security guards are expired or missing. Black mold is spreading in the shelter&rsquo;s bathrooms, many of which spew exhaust thick with dust and debris.</p>

				<p>During one visit, inspectors see an asthmatic 3-year-old child coughing and vomiting so much that 911 is called. With no air-conditioning, the rooms reach dangerously high temperatures. A month before she died, Casshanae was living in a room where temperatures reached 102 degrees.</p>

				<p> <a href="#" class="nytmm_link_media nytmm_link_doc doc_inspection_findings"><span class="document_icon"></span>The state&rsquo;s conclusion:</a> No child with chronic breathing problems should be at the shelter, and no children under age 2 should live there at all &ldquo;due to the lack of amenities for this young and vulnerable population.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>In other words, Dasani&rsquo;s family &mdash; with a 1-year-old, two asthmatic children and another who is legally blind &mdash; should never have been living at Auburn in the first place.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">I</span>n the early afternoon of Oct. 17, Chanel is summoned to the office of the shelter&rsquo;s administrators.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;They have stunning news: The family can finally leave Auburn. A space has opened at another shelter &mdash; an apartment with a kitchen. But they must go today. They have a few hours to pack. Other families are also moving, and the Department of Homeless Services has arranged for vans.</p>

				<p>Chanel has longed for this moment. But now that it is here, she feels wholly unprepared.</p>

				<p>Supreme is still in rehab. Her food stamps have been stolen. She has $9 in cash. How will she instantly produce three meals a day for eight children? She has no frying pans, dishes, utensils or toilet paper. She does not even have the address of this new shelter.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>She returns to Room 449 and tells the children.</p>

				<p>Dasani is in shock. Chanel rushes them off to therapy. Whatever happens, she needs the cash.</p>

				<p>It is drizzling out, and Dasani&rsquo;s head is spinning. All she can think about is her school. Just after willing her way back to McKinney, she is poised to lose it again.</p>

				<p>It is strange, this feeling of heading toward an address they don&rsquo;t yet have, while having to say goodbye &mdash; in the span of a few hours &mdash; to the place where they have lived for years.</p>

				<p>After therapy, it is getting dark. The shelter&rsquo;s lights blaze from within. Chanel orders the children to pack only the most essential things. Auburn has given them 20 clear plastic bags. That is the limit. They will have to come back for Turtle.</p>

				<p>At 9:26 p.m., Chanel and her children board the last van just before it pulls away. An hour later, the van approaches their new residence.</p>

				<p>They are in Harlem.</p>

				<p>Of the 152 shelters where Dasani&rsquo;s family could have landed, they have somehow wound up at a six-story brick building on West 145th Street.</p>

				<p>It is one block from the Bartendaz base.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I am right next to the park,&rdquo; Dasani tells Giant on the phone, enunciating each word. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here! I&rsquo;m in Harlem!&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Chanel grabs the phone, eager to hear his reaction.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; Giant tells Chanel. &ldquo;The Lord sent you right here next to me.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The children wait on the front steps as Chanel fills out paperwork in the office.</p>

				<p>It feels different here. The block is awash in streetlights and teeming with pedestrians. There are fewer trees. But in other ways, Harlem is like Fort Greene. Nearby is a new bistro called Mountain Bird that offers a foie gras soup and a shrimp-bisque mac and cheese.</p>

				<p>One by one, the children peek in on their mother, anxious for updates.</p>

				<span class="story_text_hide">
				<p>They will be living on the third floor, Avianna announces. She locates the silver button on the intercom, gently running her finger over it.</p>

				<p>Finally, Chanel appears with the keys. They climb three flights and step inside. </p>

				<p>It is a real apartment, with clean, beige walls and hardwood floors. </p>
				</span>

				<p>There are two bedrooms, a full bathroom and a kitchen joined to a living room. Metal blinds hang from the windows, and clean sheets are folded on the bunk beds.</p>

				<p>Fresh, home-cooked meals again, Dasani thinks to herself as the children race about maniacally. Hada opens a closet to find a diaper on the floor. Chanel smells it, declares it clean and stashes it for Lele.</p>

				<p>She inspects the mattresses, which are in good condition. She opens the refrigerator, looks at the stove and sink, and then turns toward the living room. She clasps her hands in front of her face, as if in prayer.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Oh, man, I&rsquo;m happy!&rdquo; she says, her eyes shining. &ldquo;I thank God for this. Thank you.&rdquo; </p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">C</span>hanel cannot sleep that first night.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;She keeps checking the locks as her children lie deep in slumber. The five older girls share two bunk beds alongside Lele&rsquo;s crib. The boys sleep in the living room. Chanel reserves one bedroom for herself and Supreme. It will be their first privacy in years, whenever he comes back.</p>

				<p>Chanel is feeling more panicked than celebratory.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;I got to make sure I provide,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<p>The move has plunged Chanel into the ice-cold waters of independence.</p>

				<p>She now has $39, counting the money gleaned from therapy. It will be more than two weeks before her next food-stamp allotment arrives.</p>

				<p>When the children wake, Chanel drags a rolling cart onto the subway and returns to Auburn to retrieve more of their belongings. Thankfully, the room has still not been cleared. Chanel leaves with Turtle hidden in an empty baby-wipes container.</p>

				<p>By the next morning, Supreme has left rehab and rejoined the family. Now they are almost broke. Chanel can think of only one solution. She heads downtown to Macy&rsquo;s, where she tries to steal a stack of men&rsquo;s Polo briefs and undershirts, planning to sell them on the street for quick cash.</p>

				<p>A security guard intervenes, leading Chanel to the store&rsquo;s private jail, along with Nijai, Avianna and Baby Lele, who toddles about the small, enclosed cell saying, &ldquo;Out, out.&rdquo; After Supreme collects the children, Chanel is arrested by the police and spends the night in jail.</p>

				<p>When she comes home, Supreme declares that the stealing is over. If they have to, they can beg.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Better to ask than take,&rdquo; he says.</p>

				<p>It doesn&rsquo;t quite feel like &ldquo;begging&rdquo; to Dasani, the way she has seen it in the movies, with peasants holding out hands for coins. It is a little more dignified, how Supreme stands outside the local Pathmark, his children silently lined up next to him.</p>

				<p>As shoppers enter the store, he asks them to buy a few extra groceries &ldquo;so I can feed my babies.&rdquo; Dasani runs in with a woman who pays for Froot Loops and Corn Flakes. And so it goes, until a particularly generous man tells them to just &ldquo;get what you need,&rdquo; and they fill up the cart.</p>

				<p>Back in the apartment, the family&rsquo;s spirits begin to lift. It is easy to forget they are still homeless as Supreme hovers at the stove, making corn bread from scratch, popcorn shrimp, honey-barbecue wings and glazed turkey bacon. He has joined a new methadone program in Harlem.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;They happier now,&rdquo; Dasani says of her parents, who are fighting less now that they have more space.</p>

				<p class="pov_first_paragraph"><span class="pov_first_letter">M</span>iss Holmes is worried.&nbsp;<span class="paragraph_break">&#9632;</span>&nbsp;Dasani and her sisters have been absent for days. Under federal legislation, homeless children are granted the right to stay in one school even as their families move around. But in practice, there are no guarantees.</p>

				<p>Even if the girls were old enough to ride the subway alone, the trek from Dasani&rsquo;s new shelter to McKinney takes at least an hour. When Chanel requests a bus pickup, only Nijai is approved because of her blindness.</p>

				<p>Chanel has already found new schools for four of her other children. She thinks it best that Dasani and her sisters switch to a Harlem school.</p>

				<p>If this happens, Dasani will be starting her third school in six weeks.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;No, Mommy,&rdquo; she protests.</p>

				<p>Her sisters also plead. They are learning to play an instrument at McKinney. If they make enough progress, Avianna can keep her trombone, and Nijai, her clarinet. She shows her mother the march she is learning for the school band, holding her invisible clarinet aloft as she stomps her feet.</p>

				<p>Chanel is persuaded when she hears that Miss Holmes and Joshua Goldfein, a lawyer for Legal Aid, are pressing the Education Department to approve a bus for all three sisters.</p>

				<p> In the meantime, Chanel decides that she will take the girls herself.</p>

				<p>Early on Nov. 4, they board the No. 2 train, hurtling back to Brooklyn. In Fort Greene, the children walk along North Portland Avenue, passing Auburn and the projects, where they used to be called &ldquo;shelter boogies.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><em>See?</em> Dasani thinks to herself. <em>I&rsquo;m gone and you are still in the projects.</em></p>

				<p> Minutes later, they enter the warm corridors of McKinney.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Hi, Miss Holmes,&rdquo; Chanel squeaks to the woman who always makes her feel like a schoolgirl again, back in the principal&rsquo;s office.</p>

				<p>Dasani flies into Miss Holmes&rsquo;s arms. She feels safe again, &ldquo;like I was made to be there.&rdquo;</p>

				<div class="pov_single_image" id="part_5_single_4"></div>

				<p>The principal is shocked to see them. She did not think it would happen without the bus. As the girls are handed new backpacks and sent to class, Miss Holmes makes Chanel an offer: She can volunteer at the school during the day, whenever she needs shelter. She can even bring Baby Lele.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We always need plenty of help,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;That will work out nice,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t make a whole lot of noise,&rdquo; Miss Holmes warns, back in the posture of principal.</p>

				<p>At the end of the day, the girls gather in Miss Holmes&rsquo;s office to wait for their mother.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;You have come home,&rdquo; Miss Holmes says. &ldquo;Everybody here is fighting to get you girls back here. There are certain things you have to do. Homework.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Soon, Chanel has arrived and is chiming in with the principal. No more bad behavior, she tells her daughters.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;We not gonna have that, you understand?&rdquo; Chanel says. &ldquo;Because soon I&rsquo;m about to be volunteering here.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The girls are silent.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s gonna be a totally different song this year,&rdquo; Chanel says.</p>

				<p>As they leave, Dasani turns and races back into Miss Holmes&rsquo;s office. She leans in for another hug before darting out.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Dasani,&rdquo; Miss Holmes calls after her. &ldquo;And do your homework.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Dasani shouts over her shoulder.</p>

				<p>The child skips down the hallway toward her mother and sisters. The front door swings open, bringing a rush of air. Together, they step out into the cold.</p>

				<h4>Summary of Reporting</h4>
				<div class="reporting_col left">
					<p>Andrea Elliott, an investigative reporter with The New York Times, began following Dasani and her family in September 2012. The series is written in the present tense, based on real-time reporting by Ms. Elliott and Ruth Fremson, a photographer with The Times, both of whom used audio and video tools.</p>
					<p>Throughout the year, Dasani&rsquo;s family also documented their lives in video dispatches from the Auburn Family Residence, which does not allow visitors beyond the lobby. Ms. Elliott and Ms. Fremson gained access to the shelter to record conditions there.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="reporting_col right">
					<p>The reporting also drew from court documents, city and state inspection reports, police records, the family&rsquo;s case files at city agencies and dozens of interviews with shelter residents. Most scenes were reported firsthand; others were reconstructed based on interviews and video and audio recordings.</p>
					<p>The Times is withholding the last names of Dasani and her siblings to protect their identities. The nicknames of some of Dasani&rsquo;s siblings are used in place of their birth names.</p>

			<div class="item-text"><p>Wearing shackles, orange prison garb, face masks and gear to block their eyes and ears, the first prisoners from the Afghanistan war were deposited in January 2002 at a prison consisting of cages, roughly 8-foot-square, made of concrete and wire. This was Camp X-Ray. Guantánamo was never meant to be a permanent prison, and X-Ray was even more makeshift. It was open just a few months, allowing the military time to build a more sophisticated prison complex. But a Navy petty officer took pictures from Camp X-Ray, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2014/09/01/us/GITMO-23.html">showing rows of the arriving prisoners kneeling next to fences</a>, and those images would leave a lasting impression around the world. This photo series shows Camp X-Ray today, a ghost prison overtaken by vines and scrub.</p></div>

			<h2></h2>
			<div class="item-text"><p>Three months after the Sept. 11 attacks, Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, called the remote Guantánamo naval base “the least-worst place we could have selected” to detain the men that Americans were capturing in Afghanistan, believed to be fighters from Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Some of the infrastructure was already in place. In the mid-1990s, during a migrant crisis, the United States had brought Haitian and Cuban rafters to Guantánamo while it sorted out their requests for asylum, and it had built a crude prison of open-air cages to house troublemakers. For the new prisoners, the military had hastily reopened the site, building more cages of chain-link fencing on concrete slabs. Guard towers of plywood were hammered together to watch over the growing warren. Sections of the base were named after the military’s phonetic alphabet, and this site happened to be located in the “X” sector, so it was called Camp X-Ray. In the months that followed, hundreds more prisoners from Al Qaeda and the Taliban, who the Bush administration claimed were not protected by the Geneva Conventions, arrived at Guantánamo.</p></div>

			<h2></h2>
			<div class="item-text"><p>By April 2002, four months after it opened, Camp X-Ray was mostly abandoned when detainees were transferred to Camp Delta, a more permanent facility. But later that year, one detainee, believed to have been an intended hijacker for the Sept. 11 attacks, was taken back for a 49-day, 20-hour-a-day interrogation session, according to a leaked interrogation log. The session, the log said, included forced nudity in cold rooms, shackling in stress positions, forcing the detainee to stay awake with loud music and making him bark and obey dog commands like “stay” and “come.” Later, other detainees began to file habeas corpus lawsuits asking judges to order the military to free them, claiming they were victims of a mistake or had made false statements under torture. They also obtained court orders to preserve any evidence of their treatment, which the military interpreted as barring it from razing the area. So Camp X-Ray was left to rot in the harsh climate. Its guard towers are buckling, and the cages — their doors left open — are filled with droppings from banana rats, tropical rodents the size of opossums. Troops who escort visiting reporters through the site say they have seen boa constrictors lying in the overgrown grass. In one guard shack, bones from dead animals were strewn across the floor.</p></div>

Most of the remaining 149 prisoners at Guantánamo, from the 779 who were brought here, live in concrete-walled prisons called Camps 5 and 6.

<p>Toward the end of his presidency, George W. Bush said he wanted to close Guantánamo, which had become a poisonous symbol for anti-American propaganda in the Muslim world. Two days after taking office, President Obama ordered it closed within a year, but Congress blocked his plan to bring some of the remaining prisoners into the United States. Year after year, the official policy states that it is closing, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/us/politics/decaying-guantanamo-defies-closing-plans.html">it stays open</a>.

Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others.

The company’s winners dream up innovations that they roll out to a quarter-billion customers and accrue small fortunes in soaring stock.

For some people it doesn’t work.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="2940" itemprop="articleBody">Bo Olson was one of them. He lasted less than two years in a book marketing role and said that his enduring image was watching people weep in the office, a sight other workers described as well. “You walk out of a conference room and you’ll see a grown man covering his face,” he said. “Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="461" data-total-count="3401" itemprop="articleBody">Thanks in part to its ability to extract the most from employees, Amazon is stronger than ever. Its swelling campus is transforming a swath of this city, a 10-million-square-foot bet that tens of thousands of new workers will be able to sell everything to everyone everywhere. Last month, it eclipsed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the country, with a market valuation of $250 billion, and Forbes deemed Mr. Bezos the fifth-wealthiest person on earth.</p><div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

It has just been quicker in responding to changes that the rest of the work world is now experiencing: data that allows individual performance <a title="Related article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/technology/data-crunching-is-coming-to-help-your-boss-manage-your-time.html">to be measured continuously</a>, come-and-go relationships between employers and employees, and global competition in which empires rise and fall overnight.

E.

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="554" data-total-count="7449" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">According to early executives and employees, Mr. Bezos was determined almost from the moment he founded Amazon in 1994 to resist the forces he thought sapped businesses over time — bureaucracy, profligate spending, lack of rigor. As the company grew, he wanted to codify his ideas about the workplace, some of them proudly counterintuitive, into instructions simple enough for a new worker to understand, general enough to apply to the nearly limitless number of businesses he wanted to enter and stringent enough to stave off the mediocrity he feared.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="7852" itemprop="articleBody">The result was the leadership principles, the <a title="The principles." href="http://www.amazon.jobs/principles">articles of faith</a> that describe the way Amazonians should act. In contrast to companies where declarations about their philosophy amount to vague platitudes, Amazon has rules that are part of its daily language and rituals, used in hiring, cited at meetings and quoted in food-truck lines at lunchtime. Some Amazonians say they teach them to their children.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="499" data-total-count="8351" itemprop="articleBody">The guidelines conjure an empire of elite workers (principle No. 5: “Hire and develop the best”) who hold one another to towering expectations and are liberated from the forces — red tape, office politics — that keep them from delivering their utmost. Employees are to exhibit “ownership” (No. 2), or mastery of every element of their businesses, and “dive deep,” (No. 12) or find the underlying ideas that can fix problems or identify new services before shoppers even ask for them.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="8672" itemprop="articleBody">The workplace should be infused with transparency and precision about who is really achieving and who is not. Within Amazon, ideal employees are often described as “athletes” with endurance, speed (No. 8: “bias for action”), performance that can be measured and an ability to defy limits (No. 7: “think big”).</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="8995" itemprop="articleBody">“You can work long, hard or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three,” Mr. Bezos <a title="Mr. Bezos’s letter (PDF)." href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf"> wrote in his 1997 letter </a>to shareholders, when the company sold only books, and which still serves as a manifesto. He added that when he interviewed potential hires, he warned them, “It’s not easy to work here.”</p><figure id="media-100000003847741" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000003847741 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/13/business/13amazon-selects-slide-4RP5/13amazon-selects-slide-4RP5-articleLarge.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

Google and Facebook motivate employees with gyms, meals and benefits, like cash handouts for new parents, “designed to take care of the whole you,” as Google puts it.</p><div id="MiddleRight3" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="689" data-total-count="10386" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-10">Amazon, though, offers no pretense that catering to employees is a priority. Compensation is considered competitive — successful midlevel managers can collect the equivalent of an extra salary from grants of a stock that has increased more than tenfold since 2008. But workers are expected to embrace “frugality” (No. 9), from the bare-bones desks to the cellphones and travel expenses that they often pay themselves. (No daily free food buffets or regular snack supplies, either.) The focus is on relentless striving to please customers, or “customer obsession” (No. 1), with words like “mission” used to describe lightning-quick delivery of Cocoa Krispies or selfie sticks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="10735" itemprop="articleBody">As the company has grown, Mr. Bezos has become more committed to his original ideas, viewing them in almost moral terms, those who have worked closely with him say. “My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture,” Mr. Bezos said last year at a conference<a title="Article in Business Insider. " href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-jeff-bezos-on-profits-failure-succession-big-bets-2014-12#ixzz3gdJa8T9C"> run by Business Insider</a>, a web publication in which he is an investor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="11149" itemprop="articleBody">Of all of his management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace — that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to “disagree and commit” (No. 13) — to rip into colleagues’ ideas, with feedback that can be blunt to the point of painful, before lining up behind a decision.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="11416" itemprop="articleBody">“We always want to arrive at the right answer,” said Tony Galbato, vice president for human resources, in an email statement. “It would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="566" data-total-count="11982" itemprop="articleBody">At its best, some employees said, Amazon can feel like the Bezos vision come to life, a place willing to embrace risk and strengthen ideas by stress test. Employees often say their co-workers are the sharpest, most committed colleagues they have ever met, taking to heart instructions in the leadership principles like “never settle” and “no task is beneath them.” Even relatively junior employees can make major contributions. The new delivery-by-drone project announced in 2013, for example, was coinvented by a low-level engineer named Daniel Buchmueller.</p><figure id="13amazon-vaccari" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

(Amazon came under fire in 2011 when workers in an eastern Pennsylvania warehouse toiled in more than 100-degree heat with ambulances waiting outside, taking away laborers as they fell. After an investigation by the <a title="The article in the Morning Call. " href="http://www.mcall.com/news/local/amazon/mc-allentown-amazon-complaints-20110917-story.html#page=1">local newspaper</a>, the company installed air-conditioning.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="13849" itemprop="articleBody">But in its offices, Amazon uses a self-reinforcing set of management, data and psychological tools to spur its tens of thousands of white-collar employees to do more and more. “The company is running a continual performance improvement algorithm on its staff,” said Amy Michaels, a former Kindle marketer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="570" data-total-count="14419" itemprop="articleBody">The process begins when Amazon’s legions of recruiters identify thousands of job prospects each year, who face extra screening by “bar raisers,” star employees and part-time interviewers charged with ensuring that only the best are hired. As the newcomers acclimate, they often feel dazzled, flattered and intimidated by how much responsibility the company puts on their shoulders and how directly Amazon links their performance to the success of their assigned projects, whether selling wine or testing the delivery of packages straight to shoppers’ car trunks.</p><figure id="13amazon-michaels" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

But many others said the culture stoked their willingness to erode work-life boundaries, castigate themselves for shortcomings (being “vocally self-critical” is included in the description of the leadership principles) and try to impress a company that can often feel like an insatiable taskmaster. Even many Amazonians who have worked on Wall Street and at start-ups say the workloads at the new South Lake Union campus can be extreme: marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="15871" itemprop="articleBody">“One time I didn’t sleep for four days straight,” said Dina Vaccari, who joined in 2008 to sell Amazon gift cards to other companies and once used her own money, without asking for approval, to pay a freelancer in India to enter data so she could get more done. “These businesses were my babies, and I did whatever I could to make them successful.”</p><div id="MiddleRight5" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

(Like several other former workers, the woman requested that her name not be used because her current company does business with Amazon. Some current employees were reluctant to be identified because they were barred from speaking with reporters.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="541" data-total-count="17134" itemprop="articleBody">To prod employees, Amazon has a powerful lever: more data than any retail operation in history. Its perpetual flow of real-time, ultradetailed metrics allows the company to measure nearly everything its customers do: what they put in their shopping carts, but do not buy; when readers reach the “abandon point” in a Kindle book; and what they will stream based on previous purchases. It can also tell when engineers are not building pages that load quickly enough, or when a vendor manager does not have enough gardening gloves in stock.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="17343" itemprop="articleBody">“Data creates a lot of clarity around decision-making,” said Sean Boyle, who runs the finance division of Amazon Web Services and was permitted by the company to speak. “Data is incredibly liberating.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="17771" itemprop="articleBody">Amazon employees are held accountable for a staggering array of metrics, a process that unfolds in what can be anxiety-provoking sessions called business reviews, held weekly or monthly among various teams. A day or two before the meetings, employees receive printouts, sometimes up to 50 or 60 pages long, several workers said. At the reviews, employees are cold-called and pop-quizzed on any one of those thousands of numbers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="478" data-total-count="18249" itemprop="articleBody">Explanations like “we’re not totally sure” or “I’ll get back to you” are not acceptable, many employees said. Some managers sometimes dismissed such responses as “stupid” or told workers to “just stop it.” The toughest questions are often about getting to the bottom of “cold pricklies,” or email notifications that inform shoppers that their goods won’t arrive when promised — the opposite of the “warm fuzzy” sensation of consumer satisfaction.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="18451" itemprop="articleBody">The sessions crowd out other work, many workers complain. But they also say that is part of the point: The meetings force them to absorb the metrics of their business, their minds swimming with details.</p><figure id="13amazon-landry" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

She left the company after a little more than a year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="450" data-total-count="20660" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Willet’s co-workers strafed her through the Anytime Feedback Tool, the widget in the company directory that allows employees to send praise or criticism about colleagues to management. (While bosses know who sends the comments, their identities are not typically shared with the subjects of the remarks.) Because team members are ranked, and those at the bottom eliminated every year, it is in everyone’s interest to outperform everyone else.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="20848" itemprop="articleBody">Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, said the tool was just another way to provide feedback, like sending an email or walking into a manager’s office. Most comments, he said, are positive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="516" data-total-count="21364" itemprop="articleBody">However, many workers called it a river of intrigue and scheming. They described making quiet pacts with colleagues to bury the same person at once, or to praise one another lavishly. Many others, along with Ms. Willet, described feeling sabotaged by negative comments from unidentified colleagues with whom they could not argue. In some cases, the criticism was copied directly into their performance reviews — a move that Amy Michaels, the former Kindle manager, said that colleagues called “the full paste.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="21732" itemprop="articleBody">Soon the tool, or something close, may be found in many more offices. Workday, a human resources software company, makes a similar product called Collaborative Anytime Feedback that promises to turn the annual performance review into a daily event. One of the early backers of Workday was Jeff Bezos, in one of his many investments. (He also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="22072" itemprop="articleBody">The rivalries at Amazon extend beyond behind-the-back comments. Employees say that the Bezos ideal, a meritocracy in which people and ideas compete and the best win, where co-workers challenge one another “even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting,” as the leadership principles note, has turned into a world of frequent combat.</p><figure id="13amazon-loftesness" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

In recent years, other large companies, including Microsoft, General Electric and Accenture Consulting, have dropped the practice — often called stack ranking, or “rank and yank” — in part because it can force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas.</p><aside class="marginalia comments-marginalia  selected-comment-marginalia" data-marginalia-type="sprinkled" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-20">

Or they adopt a strategy of choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players. “You learn how to diplomatically throw people under the bus,” said a marketer who spent six years in the retail division. “It’s a horrible feeling.”</p><figure id="media-100000003847737" class="media photo embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal media-100000003847737 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/13/business/13amazon-selects-slide-ZSZ3/13amazon-selects-slide-ZSZ3-articleLarge-v3.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

Several former high-level female executives, and other women participating in a recent internal Amazon online discussion that was shared with The New York Times, said they believed that some of the leadership principles worked to their disadvantage. They said they could lose out in promotions because of intangible criteria like “earn trust” (principle No. 10) or the emphasis on disagreeing with colleagues. Being too forceful, they said, can be particularly hazardous for women in the workplace.</p><div id="MiddleRight8" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Michelle Williamson, a 41-year-old parent of three who helped build Amazon’s restaurant supply business, said her boss, Shahrul Ladue, had told her that raising children would most likely prevent her from success at a higher level because of the long hours required. Mr. Ladue, who confirmed her account, said that Ms. Williamson had been directly competing with younger colleagues with fewer commitments, so he suggested she find a less demanding job at Amazon. (Both he and Ms. Williamson left the company.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="83" data-total-count="26214" itemprop="articleBody">He added that he usually worked 85 or more hours a week and rarely took a vacation.</p><h4 id="subhead-4" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="26248" itemprop="articleBody">When ‘All’ Isn’t Good Enough</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="452" data-total-count="26700" itemprop="articleBody">Molly Jay, an early member of the Kindle team, said she received high ratings for years. But when she began traveling to care for her father, who was suffering from cancer, and cut back working on nights and weekends, her status changed. She was blocked from transferring to a less pressure-filled job, she said, and her boss told her she was “a problem.” As her father was dying, she took unpaid leave to care for him and never returned to Amazon.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="26815" itemprop="articleBody">“When you’re not able to give your absolute all, 80 hours a week, they see it as a major weakness,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="495" data-total-count="27310" itemprop="articleBody">A woman who had thyroid cancer was given a low performance rating after she returned from treatment.

Another employee who miscarried twins left for a business trip the day after she had surgery. “I’m sorry, the work is still going to need to get done,” she said her boss told her. “From where you are in life, trying to start a family, I don’t know if this is the right place for you.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="27726" itemprop="articleBody">A woman who had breast cancer was told that she was put on a “performance improvement plan” — Amazon code for “you’re in danger of being fired” — because “difficulties” in her “personal life” had interfered with fulfilling her work goals. Their accounts echoed others from workers who had suffered health crises and felt they had also been judged harshly instead of being given time to recover.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="28090" itemprop="articleBody">A former human resources executive said she was required to put a woman who had recently returned after undergoing serious surgery, and another who had just had a stillborn child, on performance improvement plans, accounts that were corroborated by a co-worker still at Amazon. “What kind of company do we want to be?” the executive recalled asking her bosses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="28336" itemprop="articleBody">The mother of the stillborn child soon left Amazon. “I had just experienced the most devastating event in my life,” the woman recalled via email, only to be told her performance would be monitored “to make sure my focus stayed on my job.”</p><figure id="13amazon-merkoski" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="491" data-total-count="29254" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-23">Several employment lawyers in the Seattle area said they got regular calls from Amazon workers complaining of unfair treatment, including those who said they had been pushed out for “not being sufficiently devoted to the company,” said Michael Subit. But that is not a basis for a suit by itself, he said. “Unfairness is not illegal,” echoed Sara Amies, another lawyer. Without clear evidence of discrimination, it is difficult to win a suit based on a negative evaluation, she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="29472" itemprop="articleBody">For all of the employees who are edged out, many others flee, exhausted or unwilling to further endure the hardships for the cause of delivering swim goggles and rolls of Scotch tape to customers just a little quicker.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="29753" itemprop="articleBody">Jason Merkoski, 42, an engineer, worked on the team developing the first Kindle e-reader and served as a technology evangelist for Amazon, traveling the world to learn how people used the technology so it could be improved. He left Amazon in 2010 and then returned briefly in 2014.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="265" data-total-count="30018" itemprop="articleBody">“The sheer number of innovations means things go wrong, you need to rectify, and then explain, and heaven help if you got an email from Jeff,” he said. “It’s as if you’ve got the C.E.O. of the company in bed with you at 3 a.m. breathing down your neck.”</p><h4 id="subhead-5" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="30040" itemprop="articleBody">A Stream of Departures</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="533" data-total-count="30573" itemprop="articleBody">Amazon retains new workers in part by requiring them to repay a part of their signing bonus if they leave within a year, and a portion of their hefty relocation fees if they leave within two years. Several fathers said they left or were considering quitting because of pressure from bosses or peers to spend less time with their families. (Many tech companies are racing to top one another’s family leave policies — Netflix just began offering up to a year of paid parental leave. Amazon, though, offers no paid paternity leave.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="443" data-total-count="31016" itemprop="articleBody">In interviews, 40-year-old men were convinced Amazon would replace them with 30-year-olds who could put in more hours, and 30-year-olds were sure that the company preferred to hire 20-somethings who would outwork them. After Max Shipley, a father of two young children, left this spring, he wondered if Amazon would “bring in college kids who have fewer commitments, who are single, who have more time to focus on work.” Mr. Shipley is 25.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="465" data-total-count="31481" itemprop="articleBody">Amazon insists its reputation for high attrition is misleading. A 2013 survey by <a title="The PayScale website. " href="http://www.payscale.com/"> PayScale</a>, a salary analysis firm, put the median employee tenure at one year, among the briefest in the Fortune 500. Amazon officials insisted tenure was low because hiring was so robust, adding that only 15 percent of employees had been at the company more than five years. Turnover is consistent with others in the technology industry, they said, but declined to disclose any data.</p><figure id="13amazon-brucia" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-xlarge">

It’s like panning for gold.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="33054" itemprop="articleBody">The employees who stream from the Amazon exits are highly desirable because of their work ethic, local recruiters say. In recent years, companies like Facebook have opened large Seattle offices, and they benefit from the Amazon outflow.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="33312" itemprop="articleBody">Recruiters, though, also say that other businesses are sometimes cautious about bringing in Amazon workers, because they have been trained to be so combative. The derisive local nickname for Amazon employees is “Amholes” — pugnacious and work-obsessed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="398" data-total-count="33710" itemprop="articleBody">Call them what you will, their ranks are rapidly increasing. Amazon is finishing a 37-floor office tower near its South Lake Union campus and building another tower next to it. It plans a third next to that and has space for two more high-rises. By the time the dust settles in three years, Amazon will have enough space for 50,000 employees or so, more than triple what it had as recently as 2013.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="34067" itemprop="articleBody">Those new workers will strive to make Amazon the first trillion-dollar retailer, in the hope that just about everyone will be watching Amazon movies and playing Amazon games on Amazon tablets while they tell their Amazon Echo communications device that they need an Amazon-approved plumber and new lawn chairs, and throw in some Amazon potato chips as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="34289" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe it will happen. Liz Pearce spent two years at Amazon, managing projects like its wedding registry. “The pressure to deliver far surpasses any other metric,” she said. “I would see people practically combust.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="34527" itemprop="articleBody">But just as Jeff Bezos was able to see the future of e-commerce before anyone else, she added, he was able to envision a new kind of workplace: fluid but tough, with employees staying only a short time and employers demanding the maximum.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="34801" itemprop="articleBody">“Amazon is driven by data,” said Ms. Pearce, who now runs her own Seattle software company, which is well stocked with ex-Amazonians. “It will only change if the data says it must — when the entire way of hiring and working and firing stops making economic sense.”</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-26">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="35159" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-26">The retailer is already showing some strain from its rapid growth. Even for entry-level jobs, it is hiring on the East Coast, and many employees are required to hand over all their contacts to company recruiters at “LinkedIn” parties. In Seattle alone, more than 4,500 jobs are open, including one for an analyst specializing in “<a title="Amazon job post mentioning high-volume hiring. " href="http://www.amazon.jobs/jobs/333060/sr-functional-analyst-high-volume-hiring">high-volume hiring</a>.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="35285" itemprop="articleBody">Some companies, faced with such an overwhelming need for new bodies, might scale back their ambitions or soften their message.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="35447" itemprop="articleBody">Not Amazon. In <a title="The Amazon video on YouTube. " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWFxFBD8Qus"> a recent recruiting video,</a> one young woman warns: “You either fit here or you don’t. You love it or you don’t. There is no middle ground.”</p>

        <strong> Correction: August 18, 2015 </strong> <br/>
    	An article on Sunday about the workplace culture at Amazon.com erroneously included a company among those that have opened offices in Seattle and that benefit from the outflow of workers from Amazon. Facebook has done so, but LinkedIn has not.    </div>

<p class="lead">Tens of thousands of powerful pills created to treat serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia are given to developmentally disabled people in the care of New York State every day.<br/><br/>
But a review by The Times of previously unreleased records, as well as interviews with state employees, clinicians, family members and outside experts, reveals that the psychotropic medications, which alter the brain&rsquo;s chemistry, are often dispensed sloppily, without rigorous or regular review, by general practitioners with little expertise in the area.</p>
